Screenwriting,Favourite character descriptions in scripts you've read (and why)?,"this post is brought to you by me reading the pilot of The Terror (again), and the way it describes one of the leads: ""he's a Yorkshireman, wiry, with beautiful nervous eyes, like those of a caffeinated saint"". 

it tells you what you need to know and no more, it's a gorgeous line, and amidst the rest of the script's technical period jargon of of mizzenmasts and forecastles it's the exact kind of ethereal, unnerving description which reminds the reader that this show has one foot firmly planted in creepy unreality.

especially in stuff like spec and pilot scripts, which are first intended to be read before seen, it's a tough balance between purple prose on one hand and having no idea of the character at all on the other. getting it right is an art and i'd love to know some more examples of short descriptions, especially for character intros, in scripts that still manage to steal the ~~screen~~ page."
Screenwriting,"First ever go at a feature, got a 7, woo!","Normally I spend my time over in Novel Land, but earlier this year I wanted a break from my manuscript and a fun creative challenge that didn't matter to me if I failed. I don't live anywhere near LA but my home state of Western Australia is going to be investing a few hundred million dollars in a local film industry so I thought, hey, why not try something out, you never know.

So I had a go at writing a feature. I was kinda familiar with screenplays in general because about ten years I tried to write a pilot (it was incredibly shite). But I'm pleased to say this got a nice thumbs up with some good feedback for the future. Black List evaluation follows:

&amp;#x200B;

**Era**

Present Day

**Locations**

Australia, Motel, Fast Food Restaurant, Mansion

**Budgets**

Low

**Genre**

Comedy, Dark Comedy, Drama, Crime Drama

**Logline**

After a dead man gives him a valuable USB and promises $50,000, a hapless but determined fast food worker attempts to get the money to repay his debts and change his life for the better.

**Strengths**

DAWN AT THE BLACK WATER MOTEL is defined by greed, a theme that embodies the story and its characters, and carries the reader beautifully through a really entertaining dark comedy crime film. The script is stylistically cool and noticeable from the get-go, the author has written very visually and the juxtaposition of images such as Grant's smile versus the mascot's are great. The character descriptions are super to the point and fun, like ""a thin bald guy who's been left out in the sun too long,"" and Lydia's intro and specifically her closing line leaving The Happy Chook, which is hilarious. Dialogue and banter is witty, clever, and sticks to its tone throughout. The comedy is really successful here, and it's entertaining and painful how desperate Grant is, it really feels like there's nothing he won't stoop to as the script gets into its later acts. He's a very solid antihero, one both equally wants to see him succeed and get what he deserves in a sense. The criss-crossing of different characters and plot lines are very inventive and ups the stakes significantly, like when Barry and Maurice are ordered to kill Grant. The author has really included some great plants and payoffs, like Grant's watch alarm. The final shootout does not disappoint, it's dramatic, tense and like the rest of the script, is a joy to watch play out.

**Weaknesses**

Sometimes the motivations of characters, particularly Grant, are hard to buy early on. Clearly he is fed up with life, feeling stuck, but it feels like he digs himself into a much deeper hole without needing to when he promises more money to Barry, when he could have just delivered $20 and be done with it. It might be more believable if he owes more money than what's described on Page 8? Or, if it's more outlined how he envisions his life changing if he has the $50,000. The plot of the story is a little hard to follow and convoluted at times. Obviously the USB is the MacGuffin, but not knowing what's on it makes everyone's desire for it more confusing. How will it ruin Reggie and his family? Why does Nameless want it? There doesn't need to be total clarity, but it would help if there was a little more definition because it would make everyone's motivations more believable. It felt like there could be more insight into Raquel's decision making especially, and she's a great character that one wants to see more of. Who killed Raquel? Was it Nameless? It feels like the audience deserves to know. Additionally, the decision to keep Nameless ""nameless"" might divide some, and leave one wondering what he represents.

**Prospects**:

Anyone reading DAWN AT THE BLACK WATER MOTEL will start visualizing the story in their head, thanks to the excellent, witty and descriptive writing. This is both a strong sample and has significant commercial potential as a relatively low-budget dark comedy. Tonally, it's in the same vein as SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS, BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE and a bit of FARGO, but it feels like it still has its own original, hilarious voice and winning characters. It's also very easy to imagine certain actors in these roles, as it's a strong ensemble with a little bit of something for everyone to play. It's the perfect run time at 94 pages, and will perfectly hold the attention of audiences, and would be a total blast to watch play out. Producers may want a few things ironed out, like character motivations and some plot clarifications, but there is a lot of potential here."

&gt; The complete script is over 150 pages. More than one-third of the pages have some level of notes, markings, or cross-out applied. Approximately 45 pages have a note of significance, and in some cases extensive mark-up and re-writes. Fisher worked as a ""script doctor"" throughout her career in Hollywood and while she was not formally credited in such a role on Empire, it is clear in reviewing this script that she did make some key contributions to dialog in the film.

&gt; Much of the markup centers around the relationship between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia. Among the most memorable pieces of dialog that appear as hand-written notes in the script are lines such as Han Solo's ""Never tell me the odds,"" and ""C'mon admit it, sometimes you think I'm alright."" Memorable pieces of dialog were penned by Fisher for other characters as well, such as Lando's ""There's still a chance to save Han. They're on the east platform."" Not all of Fisher's suggestions wound up in the film, and her unused thoughts are frequently as fascinating as the more well-known lines. 

There are lots of photos of the notes, and most of her comments and rewrites are good ideas, so check it out!"

Era Present Day, 1960s, 1970s
Locations Tanzania, Kansas City, Courtroom
Budget High
Genre Drama,Courtroom Drama,Political Drama
Logline Living in exile in Tanzania, Black Panther Pete O'Neal is granted a chance to return
home, but must pursue his pardon in a U.S. Truth and Reconciliation Trial.

Pages 120


Strengths

A REVOLUTIONARY ACT opens with a stress filled escape that immediately engages the reader. This
is a really inventive and effective way to tell a biopic, combining it with a courtroom drama and
utilizing flashback and voiceover very well. Pete is a compelling, witty and brave character that one
comes to like right off the bat, especially given the circumstances in which he is in. The complicated
subplots going on with other characters add to the intrigue, like Regie's inner conflict and Carlos's
secret working with the ADA. There are so many great relationships at play here as well, the most
powerful and thoughtful might be Pete and Geronimo's, and their scenes together pack an emotional,
electrifying punch. There are so many terrific scenes, the church one where the Panthers confront
Kelley being a standout. The villains as well, in trying to stop Pete's pardon at every turn, feel
unfortunately very realistic and one totally buys the effort they are trying to put in to get others to
testify against him. There's also a really great element of comedy throughout the whole script,
whether it's in Pete's dialogue or the cuts between scenes that helps to add some levity. In full, this is
a really fantastic, riveting script with a story that really ought to be told, as Pete's story deserves a real
life ending too.

Weaknesses

There are some really compelling threads going on in the first couple of pages, but the interview with
Geronimo isn't terribly cinematic. It would be stronger if instead of Geronimo just talking about being
arrested, it's actually included in a flashback scene. On Page 56, Pete facetimes with his mom, Florine,
who is 82, but at the beginning of this time period we are told Pete is 80? There could be a little more
clarity when the script jumps back in time, there are moments where it feels a bit confusing as to
whether the story has returned to the present or not. The action lines here are mostly concise and
effective, but sometimes it feels like they lack needed detail. For example, ""Pete walks into a store
looking like a pimp. Leaves looking like a revolutionary."" It would be nice to have a bit more visual
detail on what exactly he's wearing. The opening too, as strong as it is, feels like it is over fairly
quickly. Throughout the script, one is left waiting a bit to see more of Charlotte and her piece in this
story highlighted, but overall she feels a bit of an afterthought, and that her voice should be more
prevalent. When Pete is telling the full story of his address, the flashback begins at Page 62 and
doesn't return to the present till 94, it feels like it could do with some restructuring.


Prospects

A REVOLUTIONARY ACT is perfectly timely and would be a completely appealing project
commercially, as it fits right in comparatively to recent films like JUDAS AND THE BLACK
MESSIAH and JUST MERCY. Pete O'Neal's story is incredibly relevant and given he is still living in
Tanzania and awaiting a pardon, this film would stir up a lot of worthy publicity and more people
should absolutely be aware of his story. Even though what the script presents is fictional, it would be
incredibly powerful to see on screen as a ""what-if."" The parallels with today jump off the page and the
script does well in demonstrating just how deep the corruption and racism in this country runs. What
could potentially hold the script back is the large budget it would likely require, as it covers two
stories across different time periods, and two different countries. But given this film would surely
have an audience, larger studios would likely see this as a worthy risk to take."

The entry period is very short, you have until July 4th to get your entry in.  Once again, the application is very...thorough, and you will have to submit a pitch video as well. 

And no, they still haven't announced any selected project(s) for the Sci-Fi series competition yet which closed out way back on March 7th.   I can't find any mention of it on their site either.  It's like it vanished.

See below for the official definition of ""Elevated Contemporary Horror.""  
and you can enter here:  
[https://impact.net/skydance](https://impact.net/skydance)

&amp;#x200B;

#### What does ‘Elevated, Contemporary Horror’ mean? What television series are examples?

&gt;This prompt is aimed at finding 60-minute TV series that organically  weave in horror elements in a world that otherwise feels like the one we  all know. The best horror elements stem from relatable, universal, and  contemporary fears. They feel practical and plausible, rooted in the  psychology of characters or in the lore of the show’s or movie’s world.  And the best horror always comments on or reflects certain realities or  experiences, intelligently using its horror elements to explore and ask  questions about uncomfortable truths.  
 The ‘elevated’ elements of the shows should be reflected largely by  the project’s tone; they should feel premium, smart, and sharp. And the  ‘contemporary’ elements of shows should be reflected in their subject  matter; the issues and themes should feel relevant to the current  cultural conversation or zeitgeist, and the aim should be to comment on  or illuminate aspects of modern life that feel rich and topical.  
 The series we want to emulate are: The Haunting of Hill House / Bly  Manor, Stranger Things, Castle Rock, and Lovecraft County. And movies  references would be: The Others, It Follows, Get Out, The Babadook,  Goodnight Mommy, and Hereditary.  
 **Note: We do not want to see anything that lives in the camp,  gore, or slasher space. And unless it’s done in a smart, fresh way,  we’re also steering clear of on-screen monsters, werewolves, vampires,  etc.**  
 

#### What does ‘Premium Drama’ mean? What television series are examples?

&gt;Premium Drama: This prompt is aimed at finding 60-minute, ongoing  drama series that are elevated, commercial, and set within a specific  world or lifestyle that provides the series’ engine. Shows like *Big Little Lies, Bridgerton, Friday Night Lights*, or *Empire*.  
 

#### What does ‘Grounded, Elevated Sci Fi’ mean? What television series are examples?

&gt;Grounded, Elevated Sci Fi: This prompt is aimed at finding 60-minute,  ongoing science fiction series that feel grounded in a realistic,  contemporary world. Tonally, they should feel like premium, elevated  shows that could air on any premium cable network or streaming service.  Shows like *Westworld, The OA, Devs, Lost*, or *Counterpart*.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;Note: We do not want to see shows that are bleak or post-apocalyptic.  
 

#### Can I submit an idea that does not fit under the prompt?

&gt;No, we are only accepting submissions for the given prompts. The currently open prompt is Contemporary Horror.  
 

#### Will any prompts be for feature films?

&gt;No, we are only seeking television series under this partnership."
Screenwriting,Does budget &amp; equity matter when querying?,"I have a low budget \~$1-2MM feature that I've written.

I've got $100,000 of private funding secured for it -- is this worth mentioning when querying managers/agents, or is that way too small a number to even matter? 

Or does this not even matter for trying to find representation?"
Screenwriting,"What is the most ""Out There"" aspect of a script that you have written?","When writing an outline, I have a process where I put down every idea that comes to me, even if I think it might be a too crazy, unrealistic, or just simply too much. I know that I can always pick and choose later, but every so often there's an idea that, while crazy, I have grown attached to and believe that the script would be worse or less interesting without. Maybe it's an action sequence or a single line, but I'd be interested to hear your most ""out there"" details of scripts that you've written."

Screenwriting,"Ended Thursday with 25 pages, ended today (Sunday) with 82 pages, and first screenplay submitted to contest.","Story of my damn life. Leaving everything important under the sun until the very last possible moment. This was my first screenplay. 

I've been wanting to pursue screenwriting as a venue for my creative side, hopefully leading to a more hands on role within the film industry: producing, directing, DOP. If it's creative, throw it my way. Anyway, I digress. I've only written pages here and there, and normally without structure or following. 

I've written 60 pages in 3 days, and 82 in total in the span of a week. I've literally just submitted it 30 minutes ago. I'm riding a very complex emotional wave. One side, I'm painfully aware it's basically a first draft, it's missing bits of the second act and the dialogue is clunky at times. On the other hand, I'm super proud i did it and I actually feel there is a good story in there. I've tried to focus on structure, clues, and things making sense. 

Overall, as a super procrastinator, if you just sit your butt down and write it, it's not that hard. Treat it as a challenge, an obstacle, and try to break it down in small bits. You can do it! If my procrastinating ass can, you can too! 

Love y'all. Peace"
Screenwriting,Are Screenwriting Programs at Universities Worthwhile?,"Hi, I'm a college student, not necessarily by choice, but I'm there for a degree cause that's what me and my parents agreed I'd do and I fully intend on seeing that through.
I'm sure this has been asked a bunch on this sub, but I figured give it a shot myself. 

My real question is would it be worth it to switch universities just to try a screenwriting program over staying at my current university where I'm pursuing a more stable degree/field?

For a little more context, I'm barely a screenwriter. I've tried my hand at a spec and a sketch here and there, but I've never been taught anything proper (not that you need to be). But I've always wondered if taking a few screenwriting classes would further my interest in the subject and make it more known to me whether it's a real passion or not and maybe even yield some skill. My main dilemma is there are no screenwriting classes at my current college or my community College so for me to do that I'd have to transfer and kinda start over.
And it's not that I've been in college for long, but i also wonder if doing a 4 year degree in screenwriting is even worth it or if i should really go for a more conventional degree for something to fall back on. 
 That's my question lol.

TLDR: Read the title"

**Logline**
In a dystopian future ruled by a vape corporation, a government agent mistakenly commits treason during a violent raid, which sends him on a strange journey to defeat their authoritarian rule.

**Strengths**
It’s clear that the writer has a very specific story they are trying to tell. Though it is somewhat dated, there is some fun to be had in the social commentary of addiction and manipulation. The idea of a corporation like Jvvl taking over and becoming a massive overseeing government corporation is somewhat funny. Also though he’s journey is fairly clunky, it is somewhat funny that Jvles initially finds himself in the middle of such a big mess out of sheer idiocy and happenstance. Moreover, while structurally problematic, there is some fun to the idea that Jvles must go back in time and his main source of understanding 2013 is Mark Ruffalo.

**Weaknesses**
The opening set piece is 30 pages long and immediately establishes a lack of clarity of where this story is to go. As it stands, it currently reads as though there are multiple first acts with the first ending halfway through the script and an entirely different one occurring once Jvles is sent back in time during the latter third. This problematic structure causes a lack of character development and setup, which can be seen by the need to force exposition into the second half. The writer must give the audience more time with Jvles, see his world and life before it falls apart. It would be great to see him have a stronger relationship with Jvdith as well. They are partners and seeing her as an evil version in 2023 should really crush him. Furthermore, the notion of time travel is established so late in the script that Jvles time in 2023, which could provide so many fun fish-out-of-water moments reads totally rushed through. Complicated by montages and party scenes, it almost feels like a different movie. Moreover, the writer must work on making the descriptions as clear as possible and should not write things as vaguely or awkwardly as “Quick comedy bit” or “possibly McNulty’s son.” Finally, there are several spelling errors.

**Prospects:**
Though it has some fun ideas, JVVL is unlikely to find any real interest from producers and production companies in its current condition. Sci-fi comedies, especially those that are not grounded, aren’t exactly the most sought after in today’s market so this script may ultimately be best used as a sample to display the writer’s world building and comedic ability. However, to attract representation, the next rewrite of the script must focus on structure and building a stronger lead character.

**Pages**
125

I didn't submit to Blacklist to receive notes on spelling and when I went back I found three spelling mistakes out of 125 pages. I am Canadian so they may have seen my English spelling of words like ""favourite"" instead of the Americanized ""favorite"" as spelling mistakes which is sort of dumb considering the title page said I was from Canada. Maybe I'm just jaded lol.

Also in terms of budget I should have said that it can be either high or low. It feels like they're looking for scripts with precedent and *Jvvl* is very weird and unique, so perhaps that may have turned them off as well.

If anyone is interested in reading *Jvvl* I would glad swap scripts. I also have a pitchdeck put together I can share as well."

Screenwriting,Terra Nova - (Mini series) - Episode 1 (41 Pages),"Hey all,

I've had the idea of writing a TV mini-series based on the Terra Nova expedition 1910-1912. The expedition was the British attempt to be the first to reach the South Pole. It was led by Captain Robert Scott or ""Scott of the Antarctic"".

Genre - Drama/Adventure

The polar party reached the Pole but was three weeks after a Norweigan expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The party all perished on their return to camp from the South Pole. The party consisted of five men, Captain Scott, Edward Wilson, Lawerence Oates, Edgar Evans, and Henry Bowers.

My plan is to write a total of seven episodes with each dealing with a different character in their life up to the attempt at the Pole (apart from the latter two which will centre on Amundsen's successful attempt and the failed attempt to return home for the others).

1. Scott
2. Evans
3. Bowers
4. Oates
5. Wilson

Screenwriting,"How Does A Bad Day Look Like For You, as Screenwriters?","Hey everybody, hope you're well.   


Anyway, I just been through one of the worst day ever as a writer. I am currently outlining a fairly ambitious project for the future and after hours and hours of bleeding on the pages, I delete everything, promise to get a good sleep tonight, and start all over again (maybe tomorrow).  


So I'm just curious to learn about your bad day. What does it look like? It is also important (if you're just starting out in screenwriting) to know that a bad day of writing doesn't mean you're a bad writer. It happens and you just gotta keep writing. That is what defines a writer. They keep going and going, even if there's a war or earthquake going on (not kidding)."
Screenwriting,How to write a good and funny mockumentary?,"Hi! I'm a beginner screenwriter. I wrote screenwriting for short movies and videoclips. Now I want to partecipate to a prize for the choose of a movie for an international production. I was thinking to write a travel doc style mockumentary set in the past. I'm pretty convinced of my idea but I've never written something like that. Nobody's never taught to me the way a mockumentary should be crafted. Could you give me some advice, please? Especially I would like to know how to develop characters?"
Screenwriting,5.5 Blacklist Result,"After getting some wonderful feedback on here, I made another round of edits on my script  and paid for two evaluations.  Got a 5 and a 6.  Slightly annoyed that the reviews came in the day after the hosting fee renewed, but c'est la vie.  I always enjoy reading other evaluations posted here, especially those of the middling variety, so here's mine.  Chose the notes from the 6 score because they were far more detailed.

Era:  Present day

Locations: Maine

Budget:  Medium

Genre:  Drama,Family Drama

Logline:  After her sister is kidnapped, an MMA fighter must face her own limits when she crosses paths with a cult of backwoods chauvinists hiding out in the forests of Maine.

Pages:  112

&amp;#x200B;

**Strengths**

A gutsy, nerve-shredding drama with a shocking amount of real-world relevance, THE APES OF MAINE’s early sections have a stellar sense of dialogue, and establish character with single lines. Even just Adrianna’s ‘Clark, remember that time I jacked you off’ tells us a hundred things about the character - her anger, her disdain for social norms, her gutsiness, her past - and that scene as a whole is a gem, packed full with little barbs and an overall deft sense of psychological violence, the little ways in which family members can torment each other without saying a single disparaging word.

Those early sections wow with their dense sense of mood too, the creeping dread that washes over the sweetest of dates, conveyed via little details like a gun on the table, or by cutting from an abduction to a woman in a cage - only to reveal she’s a fighter, and it’s a cage of her own choosing. It’s powerful stuff, and all the headier material in the later sections of the script feels much better supported because of how stupendous the first section is. Even there, when the focus shifts to big acts of rebellion, the script finds time for small, intimate details that paint a story about our characters: a jacket someone won’t take off. A haircut. A favorite film.

&amp;#x200B;

**Weaknesses**

THE APES OF MAINE’s first and foremost issue is terminus. The commune’s grand vizier is a less compelling figure than Arkansas, and the script loses some steam when he becomes its main antagonist. Our introductions to the apes’ home focused heavily on Arkansas and his frightening brutality - it’s odd when he’s sidelined in favor of a monologuing mastermind we never learn much about. Why did Terminus kill Talia? Why did his mother show him videos of wild animals dying? How did he build this commune? There’s a lot unanswered about him, and he sometimes comes off as convenient - smarter than everyone else and a better fighter than an MMA professional. His dialogue also has a tendency to fall into arch pronouncements, something that’s especially jarring after the more colloquial scenes with Edna and co, and that can make him seem more like the personification of a warped ideal than a person of his own. Future drafts could also explore the commune’s logistics, as it’s not clear how long they’ve been around (there’s talk of ‘tradition’ but Terminus is only 35) or what their eventual goals are (simply to build a society?). Revisions could also address some of the plot points in the third act, which feel a tad convenient - how did Adrianna know Roger would be at the lighthouse that exact night? - and can take the reader out of the tale.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prospects**

THE APES OF MAINE’s commercial prospects would be hindered by the number of locations it would require, including several sets that would need to be built whole-sale (such as the commune) and then destroyed fully (in the fire) or via VFX. This doesn’t sink the film’s prospects, to be clear, but it certainly increases the difficulty in selling it. That said, its social commentary would likely be a great selling point, as genre dramas with social themes are clearly having a moment, and there’s certainly plenty of potential within THE APES OF MAINE to play to that. As is, the script’s best shot is the attachment of some marquee-level talent in the lead roles, which would ease some of the box-office worry and help increase its odds of selling to a production company willing to make it."

Screenwriting,Question about a Spec Script?,"So I’m thinking about writing a sitcom spec script for an internship. With the internship, they gave a list of shows to choose from so I chose the one closest to what I’m capable of being invested in/interested in. I know it’s kind of opposed against but I’ve binged the show and wrote down some facts about main characters. 

I’ve only written spec once. Specifically for a show off air which is pretty useless. And the spec was only one scene, that readers seemed to like. The people who read it, told me I was good at really “becoming” the characters. Which is great I guess! 

An over share I know. I just see your guys posts and I’m just amazed by all of you, your writing, and your progresses. I guess my question is, I just read recently some “spec script rules” and one of them said, “don’t make up a new character to take the place of the main” or “don’t create backstory for established characters.”

Going into this spec, I have the mindset that it’s the company’s characters and my storyline. Like I’m just borrowing them for my script. So, the storyline I came up with made me wonder… would it be bad to… use guests and recurring characters in my spec? Like characters that previously appeared in episodes? Or should I go the safe route and write the spec featuring stricty the main cast?


Thank you in advance for your replies!"

Screenwriting,I'm just venting,"I hate when people say that they'll read my script and then just don't. I'm literally getting hot typing this. I keep asking different people and they say yes.

I asked a huge group so you weren't on the spot to say yes. It's so fucking frustrating because when I agree to do it, I do it within a few days.

People take and take and take and I am the one sitting here with scripts that have little feedback (I can't keep paying for coverage on first drafts) and everyone around me is getting meetings and reps. I've read for them, gave notes, did table reads. EVERYTHING I could possibly d. I just for once want someone to help me. I have one person who I can ask but I can't ask him for everything all the time. I'm not a pro or the best tv writer but I think I have potential but I don't know if no one will read my things.

Screenwriting,How the F do I write this?,"Hey guys, beginner screenwriter here.

So, in my movie, there's a sequence of scenes where I show my character's childhood. To end this sequence, I wanted to do some sort of ""match cut"", but... I don't know if it's really a match cut because the ideal for me would be not to have a cut at all.

Let me go further and explain the scene context.

In the scene, my character, Harvey, goes into an arcade with his best friend, Maya. A couple of seconds later, they come out as young adults.

Should I do something like...

&gt;EXT. ARCADE - YEARS AGO - DAY  
&gt;  
&gt;Maya and Harvey come rushing through the parking lot. They arrive to the front door and get in.  
&gt;  
&gt;MATCH CUT TO:  
&gt;  
&gt;EXT. ARCADE - DAY  
&gt;  
&gt;Maya and Harvey come out of the same door from last scene, but now they both look around 18.

Or should I delete and the ""MATCH CUT TO:"" and just use the action lines to specify? Writing something like ""Maya and Harvey come out, but now instead of little kids, they are both young adults"".

Give me your feedback, thank you!"

So far, I've gotten nothing but positive feedback, but it isn't placing in any competitions and is stuck in Blcklst 7 land. Even the ""Weaknesses"" on Blcklst say stuff like ""there's not much to improve here. It could use a few more pages...""

I'd love any and all feedback to help elevate this from good to great.

A few additional ideas I have are giving Pari's character a few solo scenes after Maryam leaves to America, to complete her arc. Another thought is making the whole script in 2001 so that Maryam has less time to adapt to Los Angeles before September 11th.

Again, I'm open to anything.

I'm also a little apprehensive about sending this out given how tense U.S.-Iran relations have been lately. A few folks have recommended changing the country to Afghanistan or Palestine, but I don't know. That seems silly and dishonest."

Screenwriting,Seeking Pitching Advice,"Hey Everyone,

The short version:

I'm looking for advice/help from anyone in the US markets who has had success getting their scripts read by using the 60 second pitch and queries to engage and entice the necessary parties. 

The not as short version:

I've been hanging back in the community for a while writing and reading endlessly.  Now I've reached a crossroad of information and ability though, and that crossroad is pitching.

I've gotten my most recent script to a point where it's gotten strong 9.14/10 recommend with a coverage service. It started with a stern pass with actionable advice, so I kept working on it because I believed in the project. (I did not request the same reader ever, since I'll never be able to control who is reading my work).

I want be prepared for entering the market, so I have been trying to create the 10 second pitch (a more casual and conversational logline)  and the 60 second pitch to use when I start trying to get it read by agents, managers, and/or producers. But I feel so damn unqualified. 

I've read the books, but the information just isn't sticking like it does for screenwriting craft. Each time I sit and try to say what it's about instead of telling the story, I wind up telling the damn story.  And not to mention, there's so much conflicting information about the level of detail that can and should be explored. If anyone has had success, I would love to pick your brain or get your advice on formatting and what should be involved.

The project is an action crime comedy. 

Thank you, and keep striving to write better faster!"

I have a lot of negative character arcs and endings planned but unsure how much I should dumb it down and make it ""hopeful"" or ""happy"" because of the themes. Do people really want a happy ending or at least someone winning in the end for it to be good? Will having a lot of setbacks for my characters make the story boring and ""too depressing""? Maybe I'm just being pessimistic about everything. I would just like some thoughts from others on this. 

Also semi related - how graphic are animated tv shows allowed to be, gore wise?

Screenwriting,"Just say ""No?""","How do you gracefully decline a project offered by a producer you hope to continue working with?

For context, I like this producer and we've got a project lined up to produce together, but he's brought me into multiple projects originated by people who are taking their first crack at filmmaking/screenwriting, and now he's presented me with another one that I'm not interested in.

A manager once told me to highball a different producer, and I regret it. It worked to get me out of a project that was costing me other opportunities, but I was genuinely friends with that producer and I think it made him feel like I'd been fake with him for money.

Is there a more elegant way to professionally decline work than to set your rate high? Or was that manager correct in saying you just set a high rate and they either meet you there, or they don't (in which case you shouldn't feel bad since they're not paying you)?"

Screenwriting,My Creative Process,"Hi Everyone. My name is Luke and I'm got a dilemma at the moment. Is there such a thing as putting in too much effort to make sure everything is perfect for when you eventually go to write a novel or screenplay.

I know this is to do with a novel, but it also applies to my scripts I've written as well because they are both using the same process.

For context, I'm working on my first novel. But I feel like the current process I have is detailed and gets results, but it is also incredibly large process that was quite manageable while writing screenplays, but with novels and even an eventual trilogy and a 7 novel saga on the distant horizon, I fear that my current process will become too unwieldy and I'll burn out hard.

Here is what my full process is.

1. Logline and Premise Creation.
This process revolves around obviously the logline. But also refining it and refining it until it's fully to my standards.

2. Character Motivations.
This involves using this template and filling out the specific details to achieve the basis for the next step.

Morality alignment: 
Motivation: 
Traits:
Flaws:
Development

After I've done this for every character, I move onto the step that is the one that takes the longest and I'm currently in:

3. Character Questionnaire of up to 50 questions. It answers everything I need to know about my characters and gets results. But is also starting to become extremely monotonous.

https://thescriptlab.com/screenwriting/character/creating-characters/23-character-questionnaire/

4. After this is usually reserved for plotting, but for my current project, a lot of world-building is needed. So I will probably find some questions online to help me answer these questions that need answering.

5. After that, plotting is next and revolves around me for this project where every character fits into the story and designing a 3 act timeline for each character. And eventually sorting them into a masterfile, effectively figuring out where each chapter or scene goes.

6. Then and only then do I get to actually writing the damn thing.

That's my entire process and just from reading what I've written, it sounds exhausting.

This is just a problem I'm dealing with. A lot of it is down to that character questionaire. Now I have 18 characters in my current project. And obviously with 18 characters and 50 questions, that's 900 of the same questions for each character which can get quite exhausting. And if it keeps going like this into the future, it will get unwieldy.

The big problem is that this process gives results like nothing I've ever done before and it means that my first drafts actually feel like 2nd or even 3rd drafts.

I don't want this process to be the reason I decide not to write anymore because it became extremely overwhelming and not fun anymore.

I know it's supposed to sometimes be work, but if you don't have fun with it. What's the point of it?

So I'm looking for any advice about my process that anyone can give me please cause I'm desperate."

Is there a better or more interesting way of doing this?

I have tried replacing some ""phone murmurs"" with reactionary action lines but it's still awkward looking and not every line calls for it, and I have tried inserting lines like ""Other Character: \[unintelligible\]"" or ""Phone: wahwahwahwahwah"" style dialogue instead but I don't think that's right at all.

Can I just stack lines of dialogue from the same character or is that breaking fundamental format if it's not interrupted by, say, an action line?

TL;DR: seeing ""Phone murmurs"" on a page 10 times seems wrong.. Is it?"

Screenwriting,Mockumentary idea,"okay, hear me out.   


it's 1967 and the 6 day war just ended between Israel and Egypt, giving Israel a window into the Suez canal. In retaliation Egypt threw a bunch of bombs and debris in the canal in an attempt to blockade Israeli economy and stop further occupation. (somewhat a true story lmao I don't remember the exact details).  In one of the lakes within the Suez canal were 15 international cargo ships, that got stuck literally in-between the conflict. They banded together and survived in the lake for 8 years.

&amp;#x200B;

now Imagine an Office or Parks and Rec style mockumentary about the daily lives of these men. They had loads of food and drink, so they didn't have to worry about survival and they had a whole bunch of time to kill. Apparently they held their own Olympics (maybe a several episode idea xD). I think this gives the writers a huge creative freedom to do whatever they think would happen on the ships including drama, wholesome moments, moments of comradery and pure comedy.

Screenwriting,Looking Back,"All four years of high school, I was in this film program offered there. It was a pretty good deal—we got to make dumb videos and short films and the teachers got paid to tell us what sucked and what didn’t. We learned to write scripts, draw storyboards, shoot cameras, edit videos, and even picked up some acting when our theatre friends bailed on us at the last minute (lol). All of those little things we dipped our feet into, as well as ones some of us dove into head first, would come together to to help us execute the last project of our high school film program.

Senior year, my classmates and I were handed the daunting task of writing, pitching, planning, directing, shooting, editing, and showing our very own feature film. This was going to be our biggest undertaking yet, where almost every aspect of the movie making process would be handled by 16-18 year olds hyped up on hormones and threatened by grades. I realize now just how lucky we were to be able to have that opportunity at all, but at the time all I could think about was how much work it would take, especially since it was for a grade.

Of course though, I don’t regret it. Those few months spent pulling hair and losing sleep taught me how to work under pressure, how to collaborate with people you have teenage hatred for, how to solve a seemingly unending stream of problems, and ultimately, how to deal with failure.

Because after 5 months of dividing up jobs, voting for a concept, writing a 90 page script in 8 days, screening and selecting actors, and filming about a quarter of our movie, covid hit. Our film was stopped at the tracks and hit by the train.

All of the hard work my classmates and I spent pulling a student-run feature film together was completely upended by something completely out of our control. We were heartbroken, of course, but secretly relieved as well—we didn’t have to work so hard anymore, after all! But in the end, we decided that no matter what we needed something to show for all our struggle. So as the lead editor, I cobbled together what little we had filmed so far into a sort of teaser trailer. A what if. It gave us all a sense of closure, I think, to have something to show if not a 60 minute film.

[Trailer Video For Anyone Interested.](https://youtu.be/64Nkgrd1YUM)

Basically All this word vomit is to just say things don’t always work out the way you want, and sometimes it’s completely out of your control. And that’s okay. At least you spent time making something instead of sitting on your ass just thinking about it. 

So what if the movie I spent liters of sweat and miles of neurons on never came together? I know how to organize a team of different personalities and styles under a specific vision now. I know how to write 10 pages of dialogue and action in 4 hours. How to turn a script with 5 different writing styles into a cohesive narrative with a consistent voice. How to wrap a fucking cable. Stuff like that.

I learned lots of new skills while working on that project, and even though it never managed to fully realize itself, I don’t regret a single week of it."
Screenwriting,Irish dialogue,"Yo Irish people of Reddit, I’m trying to do some dialogue in the beautiful realm of Ireland and I am sadly not Irish. How would you say say these lines

-“Listen here you dumb cunt because it’s the last thing you ever will. I’m going to beat you until your a fucking bleeding pulp, then we’re gonna snack on your food as we watch the demons come in and snack on your tiny fucking body.”"
Screenwriting,does anyone else get discouraged when a movie comes out with a similar idea as yours and becomes very popular?,"For the past year I've been occasionally writing and rewriting a script for a short film I'm planning on making, called ""Cabin Fever."" It's essentially about a kid who's stuck in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic and his parents never came back home, and he slowly begins losing his mind over time.

The idea was to make it all by myself, and it was to all be filmed in just one room, my bedroom.

Recently, the comedian Bo Burnham (who I am a massive fan of, btw) released his new special, ""Inside."" Sure, a comedy special and a short film aren't exactly the same thing, but if you've seen ""Inside"" you'll know how unique it is as a comedy special. All of it was done by Burnham, including writing and performing the jokes (obviously), directing it, and editing it. That's super unique and awesome.

The problem with my short film is that if I were to make it now, I'd probably be accused of stealing the idea or something like that, and although I enjoyed ""Inside"" very much (and being a Bo Burnham fan), I was kinda discouraged from making my short film.

I don't know, maybe I'm overthinking it. What do you think?"

Screenwriting,"As a young amateur film director/screenwriter aiming to enter the film industry, I want to ask some questions about what decisions I should make in order to make that possible.","Hey, I'm a 17 year old amateur ""filmmaker"", and I've been trying to prepare myself for a future as a film director and screenwriter for a few years now. Most of the time though, I was just kind of screwing around, and scrapping almost every project before I even started. 

Only just recently have I actually completed my first project, and I'm currently working on my second. As of now, I work on short animated films. I actually would prefer live-action, but I don't realistically have the means to do that, so I learned animation for now.  

But anyway, that isn't really the point right now. Even after a few years of trying to do whatever research I can, I still kinda'....don't know shit. Yeah, no other way of really putting it. I still have lots of questions on things related to college, making connections, negotiating with producers, how to actually pitch an idea...there's a lot I need to get off my chest here. 

I understand that there is no ""one-way"" to filmmaking, and that I won't find all of my answers on a Reddit thread. But I'm at least hoping to get a few vague ideas of what I should do. Even a bit of information could send me in the right direction.

**College Plans:** I know people on this sub constantly talk about how going to college for filmmaking is a waste of time, but I'm just not willing to take that risk. The world is a fast moving place, and the film industry is even faster. People without preparation or connections are left behind. And the way I see it, the only way I can get preparation and connections is through college. As of right now, getting into New York University is my main goal, since I hear it's great for young filmmakers. 

My current plans for college however are still a bit messy. I've been switching back and forth between two plans...

*Plan 1:* Take a major in filmmaking, and take a minor in a back-up career, such as business management.

*Plan 2:* Do the opposite. Major in business management, and take filmmaking as a minor. 

The reason I'm thinking of getting a degree in something like business management is because I have to admit, I need a realistic back-up plan in case filmmaking doesn't work out. And I feel that perhaps business management is a skill that extends to filmmaking, as it's an industry with a heavy business side to it. The question is which course do I take priority in...

On one hand, I feel that filmmaking should be the major, as it is the endgoal I want. But on the other, I feel that I need to take a safer major, like business management. I understand that in the end  only I can make this decision, but I do want some advice on this matter.

**Making Connections:** Getting into the film industry is pretty much entirely reliant on connections, that much I know. But how exactly do I make those connections? 

Yeah, college is a big way to make them, which is one of the major reasons I'm planning on going to college. Through college I could meet other students interested in film, and work on low-budget projects with them. But that's just a surface level idea of the matter. And unfortunately, that's all I know. I'm hoping somebody could give me a bit of a better understanding of how connections are made through college. 

And aside from college, how do I make connections going farther? How do I make connections that will actually push me closer to getting into the industry? Where would the opportunities to make these connections be, what would I have to do to better my chances? 

From what I know, which isn't much by the way, I've heard that going to film festivals and working as a Production Assistant are probably the best ways to make connections. 

I'm hoping somebody could elaborate more on how exactly I would make connections and find opportunities through these systems. Applying to a film festival and showing my work is one thing, and that's difficult as it is. But what initiatives am I meant to take in order to make some meaningful connections. 

Same with being a Production Assistant. Getting the job is one thing, but how exactly do I take advantage of the opportunity and make connections through this? 

**Entering The Industry:** I need to understand...how do I actually make my first professional film? How do I get the opportunity to pitch a script to a producer or studio, negotiate a budget, and get started on a proper professional project?

I assume this question is partially answered by the connections I would've hypothetically made in the last question. But even with that, I'm pretty sure there are still more steps that I would have to take to get to the whole professional filmmaking part of it all. 

So I need to know, how do I get to that point? Who do I talk to, and how do I get the chance to actually meet up with a real producer, and pitch my screenplay/idea? What would I have to do or say to convince them of my project? How do I negotiate so that I don't potentially get screwed over in some shitty deal? 

And most importantly, how do I even get to the producer/studio's door to begin with? 

**Pitching An Idea:** So let's assume I actually got an opportunity to speak with a producer...how do I successfully pitch my script/idea? How do I convincingly sell them on the idea that their money would be well spent on my idea?

To be more specific, what kind of speaking styles and mannerisms would I use to make myself likeable to a producer, and to make my idea seem interesting?

I know people say ""talk fast"", but there's gotta' be more to it than that. I mean, I'm sure being quick and not wasting time is a good thing in a producer's eyes, but what else should I keep note of. 

Another thing is that I want to know how legitimate the whole ""talk fast"" advice is. Sometimes I hear stories of director/writers talking for a literal hour, and still succeeding in convincing the producer of their idea. I don't know how legitimate that is...but I want to know what people here have to say.

**Creative Control:** One of the issues I'm worried about is that even if I somehow get past every other problem and trial I've mentioned, there's still one big issue. And that's my ability as a director and screenwriter to maintain creative control over my projects. 

A lot of times, I hear about incidents where studios would interfere with the script, and make demands to change the story. And I want to try and avoid that to the best I can. Because at the end of the day, if I'm not getting to write and direct my stories the way I want, what's the point really?

I understand that sometimes I'll have to give in and change a few things to get the job. Sometimes studios will demand certain changes, and I'll have to put up with that. But what worries me is if ""change a few of these small things"" turns info ""change all of these major things"". Because at that point, it isn't even really my script anymore. 

Obviously this is a hypothetical issue, and I'd be lucky for this to be my only issue if I ever got into the industry. But still, I want to know, how can I maintain creative control over my projects?

From what I understand, it relates to budget. Smaller budget projects are given more creative freedom, as they aren't much of a risk to the studio's finances. Whereas larger budget projects tend to deal with heavy studio interference, in order to ensure a massive return on investment. 

So I guess the obvious answer would be to stick with small budgets. But is there anything more I should be aware of, in order to maintain creative control?

And if I am to work with smaller budgets, what kind of budgets should I expect? What exactly constitutes as ""low budget""? 

**TLDR:** Yeah...there's no easy way to put this all into a TLDR section. I mean, I've got a lot of questions, and questions within those questions. Like, a fuckton of questions. Hell, I'll probably end up making another post with more questions later...

Still, I had to ask these questions at some point. Even if I don't get perfectly exact answers here, hopefully I can get some advice here that might send me in the right direction. 

So, whatever advice you guys have got, I'll take it. Anything is helpful...I think."

**Strengths**

“S1TT3R” is an original and effective thriller with strong characters and an intriguing plot. The success of the premise, which is simple but exciting, depends on how credible the S1TT3R is, both as a device and as a character. The script pulls it off, and the brilliance of the S1TT3R creation is that even as creepy as the image looks and with our awareness going in that something is bound to go wrong, we can believe the sincerity of this artificial intelligence, that it really does want Javi to succeed. The horror, then, comes not from turning S1TT3R into a randomly homicidal monster, but by keeping the goal consistent and fanatical focus the center of the plot. Javi’s own reaction is believable and sympathetic. He can range from simply annoyance at the android babysitter/tutor he doesn’t feel he really needs to a gradual, sickening realization that this is an outright danger, and we are engaged in watching.

**Weaknesses**

The script is fairly contained, and it may be a good idea to expand out a little bit, let us see more of the world and get to know Javi and Andrea outside this brief thrilling period. Andrea has a very small role with limited screentime, and we do not get much chance in this current draft to see the current family dynamic. The fast pace of the script generally works well, but it could still spare some time in the beginning to better establish our human characters. Perhaps it would help to even include some of Javi’s father, either in the beginning or in a flashback at some point, as this gives us important emotional context to these characters and what they are coming from.

**Prospects**

“S1TT3R” has a simple but appealing high concept with clear sci-fi horror potential. S1TT3R itself is an effective villain that could really stand out on screen. The ending is properly creepy and offers an intriguing suggestion of future horror.

Screenwriting,"If you love a good scene, let it go? How do you commit to 1 version of your story when you've got so many ideas and what is your decision making process when it comes to letting a scene or character go?","When I am working on a new script, I'll have pages and pages of scenes/cool ideas for the story, but when I go to write the outline, it becomes obvious that not every scene can make it in. This causes me to make changes to my outline in order to fit in certain scenes or characters, but the problem I'm running into right now is that it's now month 5 of working on what was relatively a simple story, and I'm on draft #32 of an outline. 

A story will obviously evolve as you begin writing and brainstorming, but I often find myself holding on to the original mold and characters of a story AND/OR overly infatuated by the shiny new ideas that don't necessarily fit what I'd originally had in mind but could be even more interesting....or hurt my script and be better off being used for a different project. 

I feel like I'm wasting my time re-writing an outline over and over but it seems equally inefficient to just jump into writing the story and hope it all comes to me. When I've done that, I've still had to re-write and rearrange scenes according to those new filled blanks, and the problem still remains: I'm STILL revising the story, but now it's taking a lot more time. I'd like to just get into the fun part of actually writing my script and USING those scenes but I just feel so stuck and unable to stick to a final decision. 

How do you make these decisions in your screenwriting process? When do you say ""okay. this is it. i have to move on, and although I like scene X and Z or character B, i will not be using them in this script and that's okay."" Do you even write outlines? Additionally, does anyone have **advice for silencing a strong inner critic that ALWAYS seems to think a different idea/script is better than the one you're currently working on**? That one might be for me and my therapist but... reddit is like a therapist..in a way...

Screenwriting,Legality Question,"So, I’m parting ways with my current manager. I have a project I’ve been trying to get made while with her but hasn’t gotten anywhere yet. No paperwork has been signed for it or anything. However, she’s telling me that if I do get it made or sold after the fact, she’s still entitled to a manager’s commission. That doesn’t sound right to me, but I’ve never parted ways with a rep before so I don’t know for sure. Does anyone know if this is the case or not?"
Screenwriting,Advice for an aspiring screenwriter in Florida,"This post isn’t actually about me, but my fiancé. My fiancé wants to be a TV show writer and we’re discussing moving across the country to LA late 2022/early 2023.

I fully love and support my fiancé, and I really do believe he can do anything he puts his mind to. However, he’s wanted to pursue this career for years but has never written a script. He has taken an online screenwriting course at our local community college, but he mostly watched lectures and took tests - not much actual writing involved.

We had a discussion last night about how competitive the industry is and I told him that he should start writing TV pilot scripts and having them peer reviewed by somebody in order to build up a portfolio. He seems very adverse to this idea. The extent of his plan is to get a job as a PA and work his way up from there. As I mentioned, I’m concerned because he’s never written a script before, only novels (which is wonderful, but I’m under the impression this is not at all the same as script writing.) 

Im sure the field is extremely competitive and I want him to be set up for success as much as possible - especially if we’re going to be pulling off a huge cross-country move. If anyone here could offer advice for him to best prepare to snag a job as a writer, it would be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance!"

I've had to build a fairly large list of superheros that range in power. The only thing is they need descriptions. 

I'm asking for your help in creating the power background for some of them. I'm going to provide you with a few names and their power levels.

**PL1 (Power Level 1)** \- Similar to Omega level characters (Superman, Sentry, Thor, Homelander, Omni-Man, Hulk etc)  
**PL2 (Power Level 2)** \- Next power level down (Spiderman, Captain America, Wolverine, etc)  
**PL3 (Power Level 3)** \- Lowest existing level in this universe (Kitty Pride, Rogue, Cyborg, Beast Boy, etc)

What I need in return is:  
\* Power type  
\* Sex/ Gender (I have no qualms with non-binary or fluid characters. I'm neither woke nor bigoted, I just accept people as they are)  
\* Age  


Their demeanors and alignments have already been selected so I will add accordingly. Pick as many as you want, if there are multiple people describing the same superhero I'll choose between the options. Thank you in advance.

   


* **Lions Faith** (PL1 - Bad Guy)
* **Lumentus** (PL1 - Bad Guy)
* **Fearbrand** (PL1 - Bad Guy)
* **Veribrax** (PL1 - Bad Guy)

Screenwriting,How to get motivated enough to put your ideas into an actual screenplay?,"Hey everyone, 

Brand new to this sub. I'm not a full time screenwriter. I actually have a career completely unrelated to anything film/televison. 

I did get a bachelors in screenwriting, and have written screeplays as a hobby. 

Therefore, I'm trained in writing screenplays, and I know the processes and formats, etc. I also have final draft on my laptop. Bottom line: I know how to write a screenplay in the proper format. 

I have two ideas that I've constantly thought about for the last year and a half. They started off as just ideas, but I've since developed them in my head, and I've mapped out the entire story, and characters.

I do feel I should start the wiring process, but I have no motivation despite thinking about the ideas daily... 

What do you do to motivate yourself to actually put pen to paper, or fingers to keyboard?"
Screenwriting,About the use of Active Verbs,"I have come across the advice that one should use active verbs to make his writing concise and vigorous. But as English is not my native tongue, I find it difficult to summon active verbs at will. Would anyone care to shed some light on how one can build his vocabulary of active verbs rapidly?  Is there a list I can find? I have the lists of 'Walk' and 'Laugh.'"
Screenwriting,Different Genres or one genre.," As a beginner in screenwriting, it's okay to write different genres, or it's better to concentrate on a specific genre."
Screenwriting,Scene Headings in the same location.,"I have a scene at a public pool. The establishing shot describes the different areas: swimming area, diving area, swimming lanes, kiddie pool, and lounge area.
The scene focuses on a girl in the pool and what happens to her. People in different areas react to the same event, and she in turn reacts to the onlookers. 

The question is, can I just have the entire scene under the heading Public Pool? Or do I need to create different headings for Pool, Lounges, Lanes, etc. and do Intercuts?

Several locations a have couple lines of dialogue. Two locations have main characters.

Thank you"
Screenwriting,Not sure how to approach overwhelmingly negative feedback.,"I recently gave my feature script to someone for feedback.  I received 10 pages of notes in return. 

Now, like most of us, I'm not looking to have things sugar coated or have smoke blown up my ass but... jesus christ. There was literally not a single positive comment in the entire 10 pages. Nothing.  Not a scene they liked, a character, a line of dialogue, a beat. Not even a little ""this concept has potential, keep working on it!"" at the end. Just 10 pages of non-stop negative critique of every aspect of the script. 

I'm not saying this person is wrong and my script is great. Hell, it's probably not even very good.  But I find it really hard to believe that they couldn't find ONE thing they enjoyed in 110 pages. Either that or they made it a point to not mention anything positive, which I find equally confusing.

I'm kind of at a loss for what to make of this. I'm really having trouble sifting through it all and determining which are valid notes that I should try to implement. I never use this excuse but, should I consider that maybe this person just isn't my audience? Or that there is some other issue here?    

   
Edit: Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond! This really helped me put things into perspective."

Screenwriting,Autistic portrayal in film and TV,"I posted this a couple of weeks ago and had some real interesting discussions and input in the comments section. Would love to get some more discussions going and answers to the questionnaire that people seemed to find interesting.

So we have an anonymous online-questionnaire about opinions on autistic portrayals in a selected number of films and TV-shows (e.g Rain Man, The good doctor, Atypical, and Music). It takes 5-7 minutes. 

The team that is conducting the study are: Professor Anders Nordahl-Hansen (Norway), PhD-candidate Stian Orm (Norway), Associate professor Michelle Dean (USA), and Professor Sue Fletcher-Watson (UK)

Screenwriting,Adding depth to screenplays,"What do you guys do to add depth to your screenplays. Because the one I’m working on now, I was really attached to 2 weeks ago when I was outlining it, but now I feel like I should no longer work on it as I began writing last week. I think it’s due to a lack of depth to it."
Screenwriting,How specific do scene headers need to be?,"I'm currently working on a television show that's pretty broad location-wise, and I've run in to this problem with my script where the scene headers just look clunky and unnatural. I know I could get used to it if I was told this was how it should be done but considering I don't really know the answer to this I figured that learning your profession always requires asking questions that might be obvious to others.

I'll give an example to show what I'm talking about. My current formatting has a chunk of scenes with headers that look like this

INT. MATERNITY WARD WAITING AREA - NIGHT

INT. MATERNITY WARD NURSERY - LATER

INT. MATERNITY WARD HALLWAY - SAME

INT. MATERNITY WARD NURSERY - SAME

EXT. SILVER CREEK FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

EXT. SILVER CREEK STADIUM BLEACHERS - SAME

EXT. SILVER CREEK STADIUM FOOD STAND - SAME

EXT. BEHIND SILVER CREEK FOOD STAND - SAME

&amp;#x200B;

I know this looks really gross and clunky but in my head it seems right. Could I get away with shortening things and being less location specific in the headers? Maybe only using the title once?

INT. MATERNITY WARD WAITING AREA - NIGHT

INT. NURSERY - LATER

(In this case I can maybe use action lines to indicate different location perspectives)

EXT. SILVER CREEK FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

EXT. STADIUM BLEACHERS - SAME

EXT. FOOD STAND - SAME

EXT. BEHIND FOOD STAND - SAME

&amp;#x200B;

Another example, if I have characters going to multiple different apartment complex parking lots, do I need to specify they're different?

EXT. DERRICK'S APARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY

EXT. VINCENT'S APARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY

&amp;#x200B;

or could I just use

EXT. APARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY

for both? and people can just use context to figure it out.

Screenwriting,"Two amazing stories, no editing skills.. help!","So in 2013-2014 I wrote two amazing stories (one a dark thriller, one an apocalyptic scenario that has a tearjerker ending)

Screenwriting,Is it Worth Writing Big-Budget Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Comic Book-style stuff on Spec?,"Just wondering what everyone's opinion is on the value of writing shows like Game of Thrones or Lost or Watchmen or Alias or blah blah blah on spec. Same with movies, of course.   


Especially for non-pro writers looking to ""break in"". Do agents, producers, managers, etc etc even consider specs of that scale, or are they usually looking for much smaller, much more produceable scripts?

Thanks for any help anyone can give!

EDIT: Am very well aware that 99 percent of specs are sample work. My question is more, is it even worth writing big-budget specs as sample specs, or does it make more sense to keep even my sample specs small budget."
Screenwriting,Tips on hinting at a side character's story in a spec Pilot without focusing on it?,"I'm writing a Pilot that focuses on two people, but there is a side character who I want to develop throughout the series. However, my issue is that I want to hint at their story without diving in too deep in this episode, but also don't want it to feel like random lines in a script. This character is very closely linked to the MC and their story, and I don't want them to feel like a sidekick as they have a really big backstory and journey. 

This is a spec/calling card script, so readers won't get to see how the side story plays out, and my issue is that I don't want this character to feel like they're underdeveloped, but I also don't want to focus on a story that isn't super relevant to the main plot. In a previous draft I gave them one scene where their story was explained, but it felt very left field, and very few readers even commented on it (the feedback I did receive was positive, but most of them didn't even acknowledge it). Any tips on how I can go about this?"

Screenwriting,How to relax before writing?,"Hey!

I'm writing a pilot script for my animated show that I recently found the budget for, and I'm really excited! We're picking the storyboard artist tomorrow, the voice actors on the 30th, and hopefully we can begin production within the next month.

Before I invite the selected team to the discord server for the show, I want to get the final draft either 100% completed or near completion. So, I have about three weeks to do that, which is a lot of time but not as much as I'd want because I am a very... picky writer, to say the least. Which is why this is stressing me out so much.

Script writing and making this show is all for fun at the end of the day, and I know that, but I have also given myself this responsibility to get this done on time, and it's stressing me out. Stressing me out so much that over the last week, I have planned on writing another two more drafts. As of today, I have written ONE draft which I did about nine hours ago, and it's not even done. On top of that, I was stressed before, while, and after I wrote it, and I hate every single thing I wrote down. This is a problem. 

I cant write a script if im not in the right frame of mind, but I admittedly dont know how to, so i'm looking for suggestions on... well, how to relax while writing scripts. I know this may be a really obscure question but I am a fairly new writer and havn't even gotten any big industry jobs yet, with this pilot really being my first big release that I have actually written.

Would I be better off just using the screenplay to make my own fan-made film? 

Note: I'm very new to screenwriting and know it would probably be a long shot for something like that to happen even if I wasn't. I'm just wondering if this is something you can legally do/if it's allowed in the industry."

Screenwriting,A trick to find your character's voice.,"So i was struggling with writer's block because of the main character in my story and also I was just having a slack in writing, I couldn't write for weeks and i had no inspiration.

Well, an idea came to my mind that maybe you guys find interesting or can help you.

I'm a dweeb for history, straight up nerd here, i used to hate it but damn, medieval or classical dramas are the best.

So i was just reading about some paranoid emperors through history to apply their behaviour to my character, but got caught up in one, did a bit of research (not much so I could fill in the blanks), made a quick timeline and started writing a biopic.

My lack of creativity went out of the window and I started finding myself wanting to get out of that timeline and give it more of a fictional twist to it. Suddenly I was very constrained, but I filled in the blanks in the history I researched, dramatized more some scenes between characters and was able to create one of the most identifiable characters I've ever written.

Now with other scenes I couldn't fit in the script that just came to my mind I wrote them down and I've been able to fit them perfectly in other scripts, and knowing how this character behaves and why made it so much easier to write my own.

I did that biopic draft in just a week while working and going to class, so 2h a day, and I'm about to finish the other one I had been stuck on for months.

I'm very happy and I really think I'm going to start writing biopics for some important characters just as practice and as a help to keep writing even if it's not my personal project.

I hope it can help some of you out there!

Keep writing!

P.S.: English is not my first language! Sorry for typos!"

Screenwriting,How to identify if my script is too quick and chaotic?,"Not sure if I'm asking this the right way. I'm going to try and articulate as best as I can. I'm writing my first ever feature and I'm currently at the midpoint (page 59) and feel like I'm rushing between scenes and I don't give enough breathing space in between. I do jump from the A-Story to the B-Story and I do have a Narrator that jumps in between those too but It just feels like I'm rushing it. It could be because my character in the A-Story is visiting many different locations but I'm not entirely sure.   


What would you say would be a good technique to figure out if I'm giving enough breathers in between my scenes? By the way I don't mean that I'm jumping from an action scene to another action scene, far from that, just the constant change in locations feels a bit worrying to me. I might also not have the right words to express this so any guidance in general would be great. Thank you all."
Screenwriting,Looking for a game/screenwriter!,"Hello everybody!  
I am looking for a game/screenwriter for our educational adventure game (math) that has a series-like setting/dynamic. The story unfolds through multimedia messages (video chat, text messages, etc.) on the students’ smartphones. The game is presented to the players on the edge of fiction and real-life: the app is told to be a work phone for a school-related STEM Project, and the sci-fi story seems to unfold by accident instead of the planned “regular” STEM instruction.   
The work-phone approach makes it a similar experience to Sarah is Missing but it’s not a horror game but a sci-fi/detective game.   
The writer would work together with two mathematicians and a movie director (who is to shoot the parts that have to be in video format like “fake” video calls or video messages).  
In a nutshell, it is important that the writer can co-create with our math content developers, can present the story in a multimedia format and can keep up the tension throughout the game.  
Is this the right sub to find someone for a job like this? Or does anybody have an idea where/how to look?"

Screenwriting,[legal advice needed] Ideas are cheap,"Hi there, Xgen super newbie here.

I've never been a creative writer seriously, and never published anything apart a book on cryptocurrencies and a dozen articles about cryptocurrencies.

But I've got fervid imagination, worked in visuals (graphic design, 3D modeling, game design) for the past 30 years, and I decided to see if I can enter this world to see some realized.

\----------

Many say that ideas are super cheap, but somebody said instead, I can't recall who, that ideas are the most undervalued good on Earth, and I agree with this last one.

The matter is complex and I don't want to take anything away from good writers and what it takes to become one, it's not my target to discuss that here. I tagged the post NEED ADVICE for a reason. Though it would delight me to know what everyone thinks about the matter.

I've already read the usual ""you newbies all think that your shit is gold, but you're wrong"" but I don't agree with it.I mean, I do agree that most texts are crap, because if we all were talented, there wouldn't be any need of competition, right?But on the other side, every once in a while somebody pops up with talent, and once his ideas and productions get released in the wild, they begin to be at risk of being copied.

The point here is, essentially: nobody cares about stealing untalented productions, you read these over and over and over to sickness... but then you find that cool, original idea that actually **has a value, because it creates something new**, and can be transformed in a multimillion hit.

Again: I don't want to say that the idea is everything, and not taking out anything from good writers.But I want for sure say that a good writer lacking ideas could steal one and finally begin filling that blank paper.

I have also read the other motivations about producers not caring about stealing your idea, but about buying you yourself with your talent. That's a good point... for rich producers and houses. However, there are also poor production houses out there that could take advantage of your idea and would be really glad to not give you a dime.

About me: as stated, I'm a newbie. My texts will surely need a lot of refinement. I absolutely don't think that I'll become a screenplay writer in the next 2 weeks.But what I'm scared about is my ideas, because I have several of fresh ones, and I want to keep them to try to enter this world and not give them away for free.

So, my question: **in general, do we have news, experiences, hints, knowledge about people that have seen their ideas stolen after submitting their scripts to competitions or after making the scripts public in any other way?**

More in detail: **is a subscription to a copyright agency absolutely needed, or do I retain the intellectual rights on my script right away when I put it in the open and it's provable that I was the first to publish it and that it's my intellectual property?**

Of course I could have searched for this on the net.But on the other side, I see that the matter is pretty complex, there seem to be no real black and white, so I'd like to know about experiences and facts from people that actually have something to say.

Thank you in advance for your time!

\----------

# For anyone wondering what the final answers are:

1) **You can't copyright your ideas**.   
Your best bet is to write the best script possible for that idea, so that anyone liking the idea will also take your script and won't just use your idea for another script.

2) **To be absolutely sure in the protection of your script, you need to register your opera** at the [US Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/registration/) (in the US if you are from the US of course).

Screenwriting,The ultra-cliche first FADE OUT: post.,"Hey ya'll, I'm a middle-aged dude who picked up screenwriting in lockdown. After blundering through 2 non-outlined 60-70 page plot-holed messes. I finally outlined and finished my first first-draft at 86 pages.

I learned a lot lurking in this sub (and lots of Scripnotes podcasts, ScriptFella youtubes, AND about a billion Tarantino, Nolan, and other from-the-horse's mouth writer interviews).

Big shout-out to Craig Mazin and Michael Arndt in particular who are absolute gems for sharing all they share.

I'm looking forward to taking a week off and then plowing back into my half-a-dozen rewrites. 

I don't think the final product will go anywhere, but it was a blast going through the experience and having a new outlet for expression. I'm kind of alone overseas so I don't have a lot of people to share with. Apologies for another pat-myself-on-the-back post, but I just appreciate all of you.

Keep writing and writing my homies."

I started screenwriting a few months ago. I finished a full length screenplay (which I plan to put on here for feedback as well), but I figured I'd start small. As per expected, I'm pretty nervous about people starting to read my work, but I know I have to put myself out there and that feedback will only help me grow as a writer.

I've attached my submission for the Writer Duet 48 Hour Screenplay Throwdown. They announced a theme and a prop and gave everyone two days to write a four page screenplay with a max of two characters speaking. The theme was ""secret identities"" and the prop that needed to be included was a pencil. It took me about an hour to think about the concept and write. Kind of found out about it last minute.

Let me know what you guys think (ie dialogue, action lines, implementation of prompts). As always, very much appreciate you guys and the assistance you've given me the past few months!

Screenwriting,Cursing in screenplays- yay or nay?,"Hi,   
I am working on a gay (edit: lesbian) romantic comedy. In my first draft, the character's voice was similar to my own, which means they said ""fuck"" a lot in casual conversation (like a lot of people in my generation.)

But I realized that I didn't know about how  the industry views it? is it a bad idea to put in scripts? does it limit people's likelihood of signing on because it would change the rating? or is that something that people don't really mind because they could edit it out in later drafts if its going to be released somewhere with a rating system? I have no idea how this is perceived in the field.

Edit: I should have specified it's about lesbians.i said gay as a general term but I realize that is confusing!

Edit: also one of the supporting characters drives a weed delivery truck, so I'm realizing the drug references might also make it rated R?"
Screenwriting,Just realized an idea for a film I had might be derivative of another movie,"I've only just recently began writing scripts and drafts for ideas I've held onto for a long time, and for the majority of them, I've had a lot of fun finally connecting the story dots, developing characters, etc. I like to pride myself on making the majority of my work contain either original plots or characters, and I don't usually envision myself reimagining an already existing property all that much. However, one script/concept I'm working on may be too similar to another movie I'm familiar with, and I want others feedback as to whether or not it really is.

I don't have the script completed yet, so I'll give a basic summary. The title is ""The Author.""

The protagonist of this script is a woman in her late 20s named Liz Denmichael (""Liz"" is short for Elizabeth), a published author known for her murder mystery and horror novels. Her father, Clark Denmichael, was also a writer before her, and was primarily known for his more whimsical and fantasy like novels, a stark contrast to his daughter. Clark was most known for his ""Duke Cateau"" series of books, where the main character, a sharply dressed anthropomorphic cat of the same name, would help the citizens of a bustling town with their personal problems by taking them inside the worlds of the books in the library he runs.

Clark and Liz used to be close when she was a child, and encouraged her to become a writer herself after she showcased some talent as a kid, but after she began writing her own stories in high school, her father began to become hyper critical of her stories to the point of needless harshness. Liz became more bitter towards her father as a result of the growing amount of hurtful critiques, and deemed them as her father just trying to tear her down as opposed to help her grow, and she largely began to ignore him for the rest of the time they knew each other.

Fast forward many years later, and she receives news of her father's death. The two had hardly spoken to each other after she left college, though she was still shocked and hurt at the news. After the funeral, Liz discovered that in his will, her father requested that she finish the last ""Duke Cateau"" book which he had been planning for a while and wrote the beginning of. Liz, despite feeling she did not have the right mindset to write the book, accepted the job to honor her father's wishes. She also receives a personalized letter her father wrote to her in the event of his death, but refused to read it as she felt she wasn't ready to.

For months, Liz has struggled with writing the last ""Duke Cateau"" book, and regularly pulls all-nighters just to come up with ideas for how to go about writing it. It's gotten to the point where she's barely paid attention to her own work, much to the frustration of her publishers. One night, after having a talk with her wife, Liz agrees to take a day off and rest, sleeping right on her desk in her own writer's shed.

Liz wakes up suddenly after having a disturbing dream involving her father, and immediately notices that something is off. She looks out the window in front of her desk, and doesn't see anything that looks like her yard, and instead an unnaturally vibrant hillside. After some hesitation, she opens her shed door to find that she's been transported to a world that combines multiple settings, characters, and species from her father's novels. Understandably confused and terrified, she anxiously navigates through town before finding herself in a library. The same library run by the notorious Duke Cateau himself.

Once she meets Cateau, she explains her situation, and discovers the world's residents are aware that they're characters in various books, but don't believe that they themselves are entirely fictional characters. She remarks she is the daughter of Clark Denmichael, to which the Duke replies ""Oh, yes, I know him. He used to come here all the time for ideas for his books."" After taking sympathy on Liz, the Duke agrees to help her find a way to return home.

And from here, I won't spoil the rest of the plot or ending just in case this actually gets made in the future.

Now, if you've read this in its entirety and have a somewhat decent knowledge of film, you'd probably see some similarities between this story and two Studio Ghibli films, ""Whisper of the Heart"" and ""The Cat Returns."" Just to go down the list of things I found myself that are similar between my story and the two films, there's the sharply dressed cat character, the dream-like setting, the main character being a female writer, the two main characters having to escape the world due to one of them being put in mortal danger because of it, etc. Granted, there are just as many differences between the films, but I fear those similarities overpower the differences.

My question is, does this idea have too much in common with the two aforementioned films, and should I completely restructure this movie and try a different idea, move on with the idea I already have, or scrap it entirely?"

However, I've not been able to receive this document, even after several attempts.

I get to the ""Thank you for your request, we emailed you a copy of our guide. Please check your inbox"" acknowledgement page, but no email or guide has ever arrived.

Have tried all the usual things: checking the spam folder, disabling all cookie/ad blockers, trying with different email addresses, waiting for several days and trying again in case there's a system issue on their end. But to no avail - nothing seems to work. Nada. Zip. Nuthin'.

Any ideas?

**SUCCESS.** I tried a few more times, including using a VPN with a *server located in the United States,* while also entering a *third* email address. It appears that the system Final Draft is using either:

* doesn't like the two previous email addresses I used (which is weird, cause one of them is the email that I used to purchase my Final Draft license), **or**
* that it doesn't like requests originating from IP addresses outside the USA (which is also weird, cause the contest is open to people outside the US)."

Screenwriting,"A zombie movie idea you might like, I'll develope the characters and story more if this gains traction!","A bunch of miners find an enclosed cave system with a network of tunnels spanning hundreds of kilometers. The cave walls are lined with a fungus mycelium with a darkish red color. The also release particles that if inhaled would drive people into mass hysteria. 

The fungus like substance would eventually grow on them essentially making them Brian dead and immortal in a way. The mycelium also grows at an alarming rate and grows significantly fast when exposed to oxygen. The team of researchers were deployed to asses the situation but fails miserably. They then return to their corporation, where the mycelium grew in the sewer system and eventually reaching the training port, sealing the fate of the world. 

Eventually the world fell into anarchy, every man for himself and we're the weak died and the string survived. There was a way to ward off the mycelium, it grows on practically anything, except, it won't survive on cold environments and it dislikes lead and mercury. This new age arose 13 stronghold that defended against the highly contagious mycelium. Either by staying in their least desired habitat or lining their fortresses in lead walls to defend against the damned. 

Overtime the mycelium evolved to be airborne and increase the strength and physical attributes of the infected host. They also grew in massive colonies that work in a hive mentality. 

Our protagonist is a mechanic. He found out a way to essentially kill the mycelium by using an alkaline mixture. He also carried a hand-made gun that he uses, every day, he'd go outside the walls of lead and practice shoot. This was risky but he was never injured nor caught once. One day his mom found out what he has been doing all this time and they go into a huge argument, the protagonist also has and anger issue and unintentionally shoots his mom in the arm, he has a breakdown and throughout the show has guilt trips and becomes more and more mentally unstable. 

But as it turns out, the scouting reconnaissance unit cam back and the were covered with the mycelium, a massive outbreak happens at fortress 9 and the city immidiately terminated, our protagonist survives but has a mental breakdowns in the escaping raildraod train to fortress 6. When he eventually gets there, he is immidiate taken in for decontamination and was thrown into slavery. There he insured years of torturous work and still has PTSD over his mother that he left behind, he is now 17 years old at he realizes that this was his time, he's had enough time serving to himself and he escapes that government run facility. 

There he runs into character number 2, a female scout who takes pity on him and helps him escape. He never sees her again for a very long time. He begs at every establishment to find a job and he finds work at the train station. Where he works as a train maintenance crew. The new train comes in and the are about to clean it. Until they find a spore of the mycelium. A massive epidemic occurs in Fortress 6 and the city is overrun again.

 He immidiately runs to find the female scout and runs into her assisting some passengers boarding the escape train. But they were both pushed off the train due to a bunch of thugs who seemed to gated them. They run to the nearest medical facility put on some gas mask and take some disinfectants and they roam the wastelands where they intent the find Stronghold 11, the closest one in their vicinity. 

Stronghold 11 is a network of fortresses above a mountain in high altitudes. the only access being a massive mechanical drawbridge that allows access into the city. As they continue their journey, they slowly begin to open up to each other and they talk about their pasts. As it turns out, the female soldier was actually abducted by a gang of bandits and forced her into slavery, she escaped and vowed to liberate anyone bound by this circumstance. Then the boy remembers his past and has a traumatic moment of recollection, he remembers shooting his mom and he breaks down crying.

Over their journey, they eventually run into an old abandoned factory where they could find equipment, little did they know, there was a fungus colony below them. They both got trapped with the only exit being though a doorway, not long after they are surrounded. Then he asks the scout if she had any sulfur on her, the takes out a pouch and the boy forms a small zip gun Lethal enough to deal massive physical damage go incapacitate enemies. They walk through the flesh covered hallway and eventually get out. I intend to make this arch a development arch for both of them hence why I included in here.

They make it into the opposing side of stronghold 11 were they saw the drawbridge rusting and about to collapse. As it turned out, the bridge was not used for a very long time. But on the other side is a mechanic who they reached out to. They were eventually ignored but they reached to an argument where if they were let in, they would abide with the city's quarantine regulations and force to surrender their things. The agreed and the bridge was lowered. That's when it made a very loud noise and a horde of the undead came chasing after them, they were forced to retreat the bridge

Screenwriting,Chromebook for Screenplays,"Let me start by saying I'm not a big Google fan. So a Chromebook is not my first choice. But I've seen a lot of people ask if they can use this or that application on a Chromebook, so I thought I would buy a cheap Chromebook to see what it can do. I found an ""open box"" (return) Samsung 4 (11.6"" screen, 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB storage) for $100 on eBay. This is about the bottom of the line for Chromebooks that will run Linux. I think both Lenovo and Acer have similar models (based on the Celeron N4000 CPU).

I was able to install, Fade In, Trelby, KIT Scenarist and WriterSolo. All work fine. I was also able to install Emacs, Fountain-Mode and 'Afterwriting (which probably doesn't interest most of you). Fade In's Android app worked as well, and I'm guessing that any Android screenwriting app would work fine. But I really wasn't interested in these. Oh, and I was able to install the trial version of Crossover for ChromeOS and the trial version of Movie Magic Screenwriter for Windows — and it actually worked but was a little glitchy with screen rewrites. Final Draft 12, however, did not work. It installed but wouldn't start.

The Fade In and WriterSolo installs were straightforward. Just download the install files, move them to the Linux folder, then run the following command... (I think you could also use the built-in function in the Chromebook's File App also, but I didn't know that at the time).

    sudo dpkg -i fadein-linux-amd64-demo.deb 

And...

    sudo dpkg -i WriterSolo-6.0.433-amd64.deb

Nothing more needed. The application icons showed up in the Linux folder and they ran. (I did have to set up a .fonts directory to copy the Courier Prime and Courier Screenplay fonts so they could be used in Linux.)

Trelby and KIT Scenarist both required an extra step.

    sudo dpkg -i 'trelby 2.3-all.deb'

Installed, but it didn't run. It had unmet dependencies. But Linux makes this easy. Just run the following command...

    sudo apt --fix-broken install 

...and it will find an install the needed dependencies. After that it worked fine.

Same with KIT Scenarist.

    sudo dpkg -i kitscenarist_0.7.2.rc12a.0+git.adb88139-0_amd64.deb

And...

    sudo apt --fix-broken install 

...and it works.

I was going to resell the Chromebook after making these tests, but I'm rethinking that for one reason, This Chromebook gets about 13 - 15 hours of battery life when using it for writing.  The screen is definitely not the best quality (high resolution, but you have to look at it at the right angle) but the battery life is very attractive.

At any rate, for those who wondered if a Chromebook would run screenplay applications, it definitely can do so. You have to turn on the Linux feature and allocate memory for it (I've got my mine set to 11 GBs for Linux and there's about 4.5 GBs free. About 6 GBs free on the Chromebook ""side."" I've also added a 32 GB microSD for storing media (or whatever). Right now it's empty.

So, a modern Chromebook (one that runs Linux) works well for writing. If it's going to be your every day computer, you might want to move up to one with higher specs and/or a bigger (and better) screen. I wouldn't go below 4 GBs of RAM and 32 GBs of internal storage, but these Chromebooks (Acer 311 and Samsung 4) sell for about $120 (open box ""new"") on eBay quite often — and sometimes cheaper if you keep an eye on eBay."

Screenwriting,Feature length idea finished at 39 pages.,"Hi all,

I had an idea for a feature-length script that has wrapped up at just under 40 pages. The story is set in a single evening and simply didn't have the complexity to make it to even 70 pages. Was just wondering if anyone else has had this happen, or if I need to add some complexity to the story?"
Screenwriting,giving an idea its best shot despite your shortcomings,"Hello everybody, I've been lurking here for a couple of years, I now decided to post something just hoping to get some advice.

*First of all some background* (**TL;DR**: I feel like I have no leg to stand):  
I'm not a screenwriter; I've always wrote to some extent and I still do some work with sound and music. Despite having done some paid work, I never really considered myself a professional, given my utter incapability of working effectively on other people's project unless I'm extremely fascinated by the thing.Before moving to the uk (I'm not a native english speaker as some might have guessed) I gravitated around the industry for a few years in some capacity. My first BA was in film studies, I developed a series of personal projects when I was basically still a kid. Those years culminated in a project I co-produced, co-wrote and directed. The thing was extremely low budget (&lt;5000) but I somehow managed to involve a few professionals for almost no pay and got some substantial help by quite the big name in the italian film and tv industry (to this day, I have no idea why he did it. Thanks to the guy we were able to use some crazy locations and other stuff. Now he's dead.).We managed to shoot everything but the all thing went south during the post-production process, mostly because of me. That was my last attempt at creating something myself.Since then I moved to London, worked in the sound department of a few projects as a recordist, sound editor and sound designer.Life happened, I had to find a different kind of job and to deal with some personal problems and completely isolated myself. The few contacts I had are gone. Right now I sometimes manage to get some production-music released, but that's it.

The only thing I kept working on in my mind is this idea I carried around for some years. It's a short tv series of sort and it has been thought and planned for the uk.Months after the lockdown begun I met again with the guy I used to write with, we started talking about it and developed it a little. The thing went on, I even prepared some sort of pitch bible to try imagining how would I try to present the thing. Right now I think the project is at a fairly good point.

*So here's the rub:*  
On one hand I feel inadequate. I have no believable background and I can't see who would ever even consider sitting down and listen to me (it would be another story if I was in my early 20s, but I'm in my early 30s).On the other hand, I might be delusional, but I believe this thing deserves the best shot I can give it.

I've been looking around, trying to find the best route to go down to. There are tv channels that accepts pitches, but it looks like a dead-end. Trying to find an agent sounds far fetched since I have no real writing credits. A master course maybe? Would that really make a difference? Even if I found the money for it (which is quite the ""if""!), do I really still have time for doing something like that?

Ultimately, I guess my question is: dear pros, if you're there, what would you do to make sure someone actually read an idea of yours, if you were in the position of not being someone who would generally get consideration by industry professionals due to the fact that you really aren't a professional? (well, this last one was convoluted!)

Sorry for the long post full of probably unnecessary details. I hope this was comprehensible enough and not too boring!"

Screenwriting,My first script negotiation - help!,"Hi everyone, I'm following on from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/ns30x9/someone_interested_in_my_writing_has_asked_for_my/) in which I received a cold email in which someone asked for my rates and asked about me writing a project for her. *Sorry, long post ahead.*

You guys rightly told me to be cautious as this woman seems unfamiliar with how the screenwriting world works, so I've reached out to her for a video call, where it turns out to my relief 1) she was real, and 2) the film has a budget. I know it would be an indie feature either way, but I wasn't exactly hopeful, so the (roughly 40-80k GBP / 60-100k Dollars for you stateside) budget means that I'll get something at least, although she was very anxious about what my quotes were going to be. It's potentially filming at the end of the year / early 22, so I've got a tight-ish deadline but nothing crazy.

For a little context about me, I'm based in the UK, and I run my own animation company (that I occasionally get to write for). I've been building up the company for a while now but still don't make too much money as I invest in, which makes any sort of lawyer out of the question. Luckily with work I've become very good at contracts and money agreements, I just need help to check what I'm asking is right and have another pair of eyes help see the situation and suggest some help. She is based in London, so as the project goes forward we'll meet somewhere to chat ideas, which has put my mind at ease that she's taking it as seriously as me. 

*Now, here's the twist*. The film is not set in the UK, it's set in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria. 

This is obviously made things much more confusing for me and something that both excites and worries me. On one hand, what a great opportunity to learn about another culture and work with new things, on the other, I'm a 23-year-old white male who's been recruited to write a story that's both with a female lead and is set in Nigeria, a country I've never been to (I've never even visited the continent). I couldn't help but laugh on call as she described it, but she assured me race and gender didn't matter and she wanted me. Now the big question is, in the era of accountability culture, in layman's terms, will this basically fuck my career forever as cultural appropriation? I've been hired, I'll do my research, I'll speak to people on the production team from the area, and I've mentioned to the lady looking to pay me that I think it's best that I write without local dialect and colloquialisms for fear of messing it up, and the actors / a local writer can make my script more native. I'm desperate to get into the writing industry, but I'd rather not get blacklisted at stage one. I'd love to know your thoughts. 

Moving onto the budget, given the production budget, what do you think would be a good number? In my draft email, I've quoted one number that includes first, second and final draft, research time and a set amount of meetings and discussion, and I've stated I'll quote rates for extra time needed for any of that stuff. Is that a normal way to do things, or should I quote differently? I'm also going to request four payments, before, after draft one, two and the end. Is that good?

I've also specified a few of the details I want the contract to include. 

* I get final say of getting a screenplay credit (in case they fuck it up)
* I either speak to the production manager before I start to get a list of locations and technical limitations, or I just write whatever I want and they take it or leave it. 
* Written accounts of all deliverables, extra rates, timelines etc etc.

I also thought about saying that I'd take money for any scenes that were dramatically changed after I handed the final script in, so if they go change everything I not only don't have to associate myself with it, but I also get paid out for the wasted time. I'm not sure if that's standard practice or would scare her off. 

Another element to this is we briefly discussed flying me out there for the start of production to speak to the cast/crew to ensure a smooth handover. In my draft email, I've stated that I'd love to do that, but would need to be paid for flights and accommodation to get out there. I'm a little nervous to go out alone so I was thinking of asking them if I go out to pay for myself and an 'assistant' so I don't go get human trafficked. I've got a friend in the area who's an investigative journalist, so if not I'd likely ask him to accompany me while we are out there. 

I don't mean to be so stereotypical about Africa, it's more so the context of the production that makes me a little cynical about intentions. The lady is older and a first-generation immigrant, so she has basically no digital footprint. I don't think I'm going to go ahead until she gets me in contact with the production company so I know everything is legit. 

Thanks for reading, I'd love to hear some input because I'm extremely out of my league here. Ultimately money isn't really my primary goal here, getting into the industry is, I just need to know if it sounds like it's worth it and still makes it viable for me financially and legally. I'd be extremely excited to research the culture and get involved as much as I can. Hollywood / LA really doesn't interest me and I don't see a world where I move there permanently to pursue a career, so I'm reserved but excited. 

Please feel free to drop your two cents in or ask any questions, I could really use the help. Oh, and sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes, I'm writing this on my phone . 

TL/DR: Help."
Screenwriting,Tips for running a writer's room with no pilot or series bible?,"Hello,

I've been working in a small writer's room for three years and this year I will be running the room on my own. Though I've gleaned some ideas over the years about how to manage the team, I'd love some advice for running productive meetings. Here are some traits of the room/series:

* Episodes are written week to week (cannot write far in advanced due to nature of show)
* The room will be creating the series almost entirely from scratch (no existing pilot or bible-- this season is more a spin-off of the previous seasons)
* Half the writers will be new to the series this season

I really want to keep going and write that 6th script or do another re-write or something, but part of me wonders if I’m just destined to be a good-not-great writer.

Someone who consistently gets into the quarterfinals in competitions but doesn’t win them. A ‘7’ writer, if you will. 

Is there hope for someone like me, or should I put my interests elsewhere?

That just isn’t me, and I’m fine with that.

Screenwriting,Do big time jumps work?,"Hi Friends—

I'm writing a historical drama where our hero is kidnapped in Act 1 at the age of 10. I'd like to have a large passage of time (roughly 8-10 years) as we go into Act 2.  Basically, enough time that we would definitely move from using a child actor to an adult. 

This got me thinking — ""What are the best techniques a writer can use to implement a large passage of time?""

Do we go with a FADE TO BLACK —  Super: 10 years later — FADE IN. ? 

Or maybe a montage of events demonstrating this long  passage of time ? 

Anyone have any  good examples of big time jumps used effectively  in recent movies?  (I think of *The Natural* and *The Lion King)*

Screenwriting,"I don't think there's ever been acephobia in a script, so I'm making one with it.","Context: This is a fan transcript for a fake premiere of a fake tv series in the MSM fandom, but all the logic in scriptwriting still applies.

Hedwig is my main character. He's Swiss, asexual, a weapons expert, and a bit snarky but hopelessly romantic. He belongs to my fanmade supernatural monster class known as the Clockids, heavily inspired by the Small World dolls and who don't know that their homeworld Blairora is just one planet in the Monster Multiverse, or that their entire biosphere - or should I say mechosphere - evolved from the bacteria living inside a magic discarded watch thrown into the scorching, metal-rich oceans of Blairora 800 million years ago. His hometown is a traditional one, also heavy exporters of clocks and music, against any physical violence. Hedwig works both as a miner excavating the metals used to make the clocks and as a bell ringer in the town's prestigious orchestra. He wants to enjoy the small roles he has in life, but people there hate anything that's even slightly offbeat, since they have this toxic ""slippery slope"" mentality.

Unlike most other sources where they nail LGBTQ representation, Hedwig being asexual **does** matter. It's supposed to be relevant to the plot, along with his knack for weaponry. See, Hedwig was forced into the orchestra by the conductor, who loves making others conform but is outstanding at hiding it. On an offnote, despite being a trash person the conductor is not a thief. He does his own thing with his compositions and is truly talented with music. He just, along with the townsfolk, doesn't understand how someone can *not* experience sexual attraction. Even members of LGBTQIA in real life are prone to misunderstanding asexuality. Also, the Clockids are technically self-reproducing robots, so they don't adhere to the same natural laws of species as humans do. A Clockid's sexuality doesn't just come with the package, it has to be preprogrammed into their personality in the womb, and drawing my own views on the original ride, the society as a whole is hypersexual and heteronormative. If God meant for everyone to be fruitful and multiply, why would he allow people who aren't interested? Therefore, the only logical reason Hedwig can be asexual is if one embryonic nanomachine forgot to add sexual attraction, making them a deviant as well, or if his motherboard experienced an error midway that went unnoticed. The point being, he isn't seen as a person. He is perceived as a *defect*. And his other traits don't help at all.

The first few pages between the town's subtle discrimination of him and him just trying to do his jobs will show the viewer that the image people have of him is uncalled for but at the same time not unreasonable. This will be framed as something Hedwig is used to. They've adopted the real-life strawman of an asexual: mentally ill, heartless, childish, celibate. Hedwig actually seems to believe this, viewing himself as a reproductive dead end. He has abandoned all hope of rehabilitating his image, and now he plays into the monster narrative completely. (Do you see where I'm going this?) It's then revealed that his platonic love interest, a Japanese besmirched noble's daughter named Rin, is aromantic and perpetually horny. Their contrasting identities and cultures put a strain on their friendship before the plot began, giving Hedwig an even worse past. He regrets that he might have blown it with the only person in this world who understands.

We then learn more about the Monster Multiverse itself. The next scene after the inciting incident shows us a bit of its true nature: the stolen musical talents of some of the Clockids being used to create more monsters. There turns out to be a pecking order, where characters who aren't a part of any song are those who have the lowest place in the hierarchy, so they are converted to expand the empire, if you will. Although Truccus, the cheery and brave deuteragonist monster, has lived a calm and happy life in the Upbeat lands, he quickly realizes through meeting Hedwig that he won't be able to ignore the truth any longer, and they both have no choice but to take action.

How does that relate to acephobia? Well, the monster power at be, Xalaikhan, says that all of these non-musician freaks on worlds he doesn't own poison his perfect multiverse. And what is this perfect multiverse that Lord Xal aspires to? All these other species, Clockids included, wouldn't exist. There wouldn't be anything left of them but the sounds they made. Xalaikhan is obsessed with order and image, above all else. Never mind how he took the throne. What's important is he wants his Multiverse to be the most pleasant, the most harmonious of all. The worlds that don't dedicate their whole lives to music are simply too deviant, too strange, too abnormal to exist in this musicverse he wants to build. Under Xalaikhan's command and desire, the empire under which Truccus lives has an all-mighty and (not-so) omnipresent beaurocracy regulating all life in the multiverse and imposing a rigid structure on it. When a planet is chosen to create monsters, it is put under the care of a biodioadministrator. The admin kickstarts genesis, decides on the emergence of new monsters, accepts adaptations, oversees the evolution of any number of species on the planet into rational beings, and most importantly, follows all the administrative steps required by the emperor himself, which means a shitton of paperwork. But any music that isn't the result of *all* these steps is not considered beautiful or desirable. The official goal of all of this is to make the monsters reach the point where they develop the concept of money so they can pay taxes, but the real goal every biodioadministrator has is to push the monsters on the planet to develop scripture, from which point they can compose their own music and the admin can leave the planet. Who the monsters are doesn't matter to Xal, all that matters is what they make.

Now here's another thing: the Clockids are different from all other beings in the Multiverse. By some common case of a coverup from the beaurocracy, Blairora is actually out of Xal's reach. He owned the watch the Clockids all originated from, but he threw it into the depths of space out of rage, never expecting it to find its way to a planet perfect for life to emerge. In seawater containing large quantities of metals and electricity at more than 120 degrees Celsius, the thermophilic bacteria from the clock began to self-propagate. Where the sun could not reach, they gained energy through clever chemosynthesis. This later allowed the primitive and ineffective photosynthesizers already on the planet to thrive and become multicellular plants, their waste products calming down the rest of the planet. The thermophilic bacteria took the role of the heterotrophs in their scenario, figuring out how to form exterior and interior systems providing support, motility, and cognition using the metal in their bodies. We took 3 billion years to get past the first steps, yet these guys cracked the code within months. From those bacteria, Blairora followed unregulated, wild eras of evolution uncannily similar to Earth's, an explosion of life abiding to both Darwinian and Lamarckian principles, resulting in a creature between living and mechanical. In other words, a singularitist's wet dream, a biodioadmin's nightmare. This is, by the way, the reason why Xal was never told about the Clockids beforehand, but it's more reasonable that he doesn't care. The Clockids aren't important, it's the social status that they give him that matters. Hedwig is an outsider *squared.*

In this sense, Emperor Xalaikhan represents a certain form of normativity, focused on a rigid social  hierarchy and upholding archaic norms even if he doesn't fit neatly into them. Xal doesn't accept his incapability of music; he actively tries to hide it and deny it. It's probably best expressed by the real life idea of hegemonic masculinity - i.e. men run the risk of subordination when they don't practice gender consistent with the dominant ideology. In order to avoid subordination, Emperor Xal aspires to an idealized masculinity, constructed in relation to music, and closely connected to the institution of content creation. Even though I'm still questioning if I'm asexual myself, I am certain that I'm not alone in saying that this idea of a norm is pretty obvious when you yourself don't fit into it. I also think this is what make Xal an interesting villain: instead of running from the norm, Xal aspires to it. And this is what contrasts him from Hedwig. It's worth noting other differences between Emperor Xal and Hedwig. Although Xal is more socially accepted in theory, it's superficial. Most monsters don't even know he exists. He's extremely sensitive about his abilities and appearance. On the other hand, despite being largely insecure about his lack of sexuality, is far more at home with his personality and skills than Xal is. Hedwig is humble, but he's a lot more confident. One could also argue that Hedwig is freer than Xal, even though he's at the bottom of the ladder. Of course everyone's definitions differ, but for Hedwig, freedom isn't assimilation. Hedwig's idea of freedom is time with friends when he can have interests outside of music and just be himself.

I'd like to know what everyone thinks of this."

I was wondering about any thoughts or advice anyone had about writing for the streaming age. I grew up on network television and my natural script-writing rhythm for TV comes from watching sitcoms and procedurals that had commercial breaks. These days, especially with Netflix, Apple TV, HBO, AMC, Hulu, etc, et al, developing more and more original content, I find I'm unsure how to make stories flow the same without natural lulls for commercials, or without making them feel forced. 

I know part of it is likely me being hard on myself as a writer (don't we all?), but I was wondering if anyone else felt the same awkwardness in script-writing in recent years, and if so, how you overcame it? I think it's super interesting to watch the industry move, and learning how to adapt is fun, but I am curious how others deal with it."

Story details: This is a film exploring mental illnesses. I am certainly no expert on the topic.

Screenwriting,"What's the dumbest piece of ""research"" you ever distracted yourself from writing with?","So I just caught myself going down a 10-minute rabbit hole trying to determine when single serve plastic cups of coffee creamer became common place in diners because I'm writing a screenplay set in the late 70's and was going to have a character fidget by stacking them into little towers.

I'm sure many of us have such moments of goofy procrastination. What's your silliest?

Screenwriting,"Best way to refer to the main group of characters besides saying ""Protagonist and the gang""","Shit it's been a while since I've asked such a basic question, but after finishing a new script I realized most of my writing is:

""Hsiu and the gang walk over""

""Hsiu and the group look around""

""Hsiu fights while the rest of the group watches""

It just sounds so corny and repetitive Is there a better way to do this? It seems really repetitive, but I also don't wanna name each character every time we cut back to them."
Screenwriting,Looking for some ideas/suggestions/feedback for my work in progress,"Hey everyone, I hope you all had a nice, relaxing and enjoyable weekend. Anyway, I’m in the beginning stages/process of writing a low/no budget, contained type stalker thriller with limited characters. Reason being is I’m actually hoping to film this myself. But I’m stuck on ideas, at least on ones that haven’t been seen before in these types of films. Would anyone be willing to give me some ideas/suggestions/feedback for my work in progress? Here’s where I’m at with my story/idea right now…

The story begins with Caleb and his boyfriend Josh, who are at home watching a movie in the living room one night. However, Josh keeps dozing off, while Caleb seems to be paying more attention to his phone. Caleb is scrolling through Facebook when he gets a random message from a guy named Lucas. They briefly start chatting when Josh complains about Caleb paying more attention to his phone than the movie. Caleb then quickly snaps back and complains about Josh falling asleep. Josh sarcastically apologizes for being tired, considering he’s the only one with a job at the moment. He then tells Caleb goodnight and storms off to the bedroom. Annoyed and upset with Josh, Caleb decides to continue his conversation with Lucas. They quickly begin flirting and Lucas ultimately ends up asking Caleb to meet up. However, Caleb suddenly feels guilty and ends up ignoring Lucas before joining Josh in bed.

The next morning, Caleb wakes up after Josh has already left for work, and finds an apology note from Josh from their argument the night before. Caleb then gets online and starts applying for more jobs. He gets another message from Lucas, but chooses to ignore it. After applying for jobs, Caleb cleans up around the house, then goes outside to mow. After mowing, Caleb hops in the pool to cool off when Lucas messages him again. Caleb ignores it yet again, but also senses that he is being watched. Later that evening, Caleb is preparing dinner when he gets a text from Josh, telling Caleb he has to work late. Josh apologizes and tells Caleb he doesn’t have to wait up for him. Caleb suddenly feels defeated when all of a sudden, he once again gets another message from Lucas, asking Caleb if he’s ignoring him now. Feeling lonely and upset about Josh, Caleb finally decides to message Lucas back, seeing a potential opportunity to hook up with him. They exchange Snapchats and quickly begin flirting. However, their flirtatious snaps quickly take a dark turn when Lucas starts sending Caleb snaps as he gets closer and closer to his address, even before Caleb gives it to him. This quickly sends a red flag to Caleb and Caleb tells Lucas to leave him alone. However, Lucas sends Caleb one more snap, seemingly from across the street from his house. Caleb nervously swings open the door and is startled to see Josh, who has just arrived home. Josh questions Caleb about his frantic/nervous behavior and Caleb questions back by asking Josh why he told him he was working late. Josh tells Caleb he wanted to surprise him to make up for their argument. 

Over the next few days, Lucas continues to stalk/harass Caleb, while Caleb tries to keep Lucas and his increasingly threatening behavior a secret from Josh. 

Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions/feedback for me? I would greatly appreciate it, as I’m kind of finding myself stuck at the moment."
Screenwriting,SIGNED copies of ROBOCOP (1987) SCRIPT to support Kickstarter,"I’m running a Kickstarter for a short horror film called VIRGIL. To help me raise funds, my good friend and mentor MICHAEL MINER, along with his co-writer EDWARD NEUMIER have agreed to give me a few signed copies of the shooting draft for the original 1987 ROBOCOP. We’ve also got signed VHS/DVD/Blu-Rays up for grabs, if that’s more your speed. 

Miner and Neumier aren’t really Convention types. In fact, to my knowledge, they have never attended a convention together. So getting something from both of them is actually pretty darn rare. Like, I couldn’t find anything for sale online. 

Check out the page and snag yours ASAP. It was a big ask to get them to agree, so supplies are very limited. 

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/virgilshort/virgil

POST-SCRIPT: if you DO pick one up, you can message me here and I’ll get it personalized for you. I might be able to pull a poster instead of a BluRay. Or even a signed draft of their unmade sequel, ROBOCOP: The CORPORATE WARS. Just lemme know your special request and I will make it happen. I’m only offering this to Redditors, you can’t get these variant options otherwise."

Screenwriting,WORKING ON SCENE FOR 15 MIN FILM AND I NEED FEEDBACK!,"Hey everyone,  Here, an anime villain (DIO) tells a teacher (MR MENDEZ) about his plan for conquering the school. DIO needs Mr. Mendez for his plan; however, he is hesitant since it involves manipulation and murder. This scene should serve to establish DIO’s intentions / character and to foreshadow the plan that’ll be demonstrated throughout the film.  

Specifically, I need: 

\* Whether DIO’s personality is fleshed out and understood by audience members. 

\* If how DIO attempts to lure Mr. Mendez seems realistic. If not, what's a more effective way for persuading Mr. Mendez? 

\* Whether the dialogue flows and sounds natural. I struggle with writing dialogue.  

Other feedback is also greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading!

Screenwriting,Question: How are scripts building on existing property treated? Do people prefer wholly unique material?,"I know most screenwriting books will tell you to write about your own worlds, about your own experiences.  However, when you have an idea that can expand on existing material in a new direction, sometimes it can be just as fun to write.  I am not talking about fan fiction, but setting a new story in the an existing world.

Example: The *Cobra Kai* series takes a spin within the universe of the original *Karate Kid* movies -- from the perspective of Johnny Lawrence rather than Daniel LaRusso.  

To be sure these kinds of stories require a lot more from a legal/clearance/rights perspective.  They also have a built in fan base (or at least ""interest"" base), which we know Hollywood likes given the popularity of sequels.

Does anyone have pros or cons for this?"

I love writing stories, and I love films, but I just can't love reading scripts."
Screenwriting,Wondering about Trelby? The free script writing software with one extremely terrible design choice,"Trelby is free, so i'm not holding it to super high standards. You can figure out how to do most things with a bit of googling and fiddling, but you'll never be able to bold or italicize in descriptions or dialogue. You'll never be able to get a text headers and footers on each page. You can only export as a PDF, it's not compatible with any other screenwriting tool in existence. All that is fine though, they're understandable limitations, because it's free.

One thing i do *NOT* forgive and will *NEVER* understand is why, when you close the thing, it gives you a prompt ""There are unsaved changes, are you sure you want to close without saving?"" And clicking ""YES"" to that closes your script without saving. When every other writing program does what is basically established practice at this point: asking if you WANT to save the changes, and if you click ""YES,"" it saves them. 

I've never lost anything because of this, but it just shows such a lack of thought about the end user, it infuriates me on principle."

Screenwriting,How to deal with narcissism and delusional-ism… In yourself?,"Yeah… Yeeeeah…

I’m sure that this is something that *all* screenwriters have had to deal with at one point or another, but either way, I have never found any answers or solutions for this.

I have issues with narcissism, delusional-ism, and grandiosity. Sometimes, this will work in my favour *beautifully*, (Ex: Feeling the need to outdo *everyone else* on an academic assignment, accomplish the assignment to *my standard*, hand it in, get 100%).

And other sometimes, *especially with creative projects*, things go downhill. Slowly… but then faster. And faster. *And faster.* (Ex: Become infatuated with an idea, develop it, develop it even more, develop it to the point it is too much for me to actually accomplish, have it be the center of all my thoughts, carry on with delusions of talk-show interviews, success, meanwhile *there isn’t even a document open on the screen*, eventually abandon the whole thing once a single thing about it doesn’t go my way)

I have had a recent idea for a television show. But right now, I am noticing I am going right back into the downhill spiral. I’d say that I am in the stages of both *developing it*, and having it *be the center of all my thoughts*.

One of the things driving this delusional-ism this time is the fact that they greenlit shows and films that *would obviously fail*, and in comparison with my idea, my ego would basically explode. (Ex: *The Emoji Movie, Forever, Heathers (2018), Anything about oil in North Dakota*)

As I’ve said, *I’m sure* that everyone else here has gone through the same thing as I at one point or another. But now that I recognize what is going on, my question is *how can I break myself out of this cycle???*"

This is a script that I actually intend to make (yes I know easier said than done).

I took a lot of inspiration from Reservoir dogs after looking at videos on YouTube for film making advice and Tarantino said “just make Reservoir dogs” so I thought…bet.

I’ve managed to make a crime thriller that is only set inside of one room (bar like 1-2 scenes) and which could be shot on an incredibly low budget. I really wanted to write a script that would challenge my dialogue skills and this script definitely improved those skills as I found myself digging deep to get through some scenes.

This might be somewhat subjective, but could someone recommend some mysteries that end with the detective guessing the killer without being 100% certain that they are correct?

I think I might have seen a few where the detective discovers someone's motive.  It doesn't necessarily equate to guilt, but they cut to the killer making plans to escape or kill another victim (and this confirms their guilt).  The movie or episode then ends with a race against time.  

I think this might be the best I can manage for the story I'm writing, and I'd like to see examples of when this works and when it doesn't

Screenwriting,Should my hour-long drama pilot stick to a 5 act structure? Do I need a teaser?,"The reason why I'm asking is because my ""teaser"" (anything before the opening titles) runs 10 pages. Basically everything build up to the opening titles, a bit like that ""first mission"" in every Mission Impossible movies. It sets up the world, the characters, and what they do... but I could argue that those 10 pages ARE my act one... so I wouldn't need a teaser. 

Help!"

Screenwriting,Scripts that don't include much dialogue.,"I've recently watched A Quiet Place Part II and it reminded me of an idea I'd had for a feature a while ago.

When I've previously written features and TV pilots, dialogue is always my favourite part of it and, I believe, where my writing is at its strongest.

I wonder if you could recommend to me some films/scripts that are along the same lines as the A Quiet Place films and don't include too much dialogue. Even better if you can post where I can find them too!

Thanks in advance."

Screenwriting,Aaron Sworkins Master Class.,"So i was watching Aaron Sworkins master class and he had a bunch of up and coming screenwriters at a writers table. Each one of them, pitched their scripts.

Aaron gave a lot of feedback on their screenplays but i couldnt help but notice, that he gave negative marks to people who's scripts were not ""Aaron Sworkin Es"" If they were not in his style he gave negative remarks and if they were in his style he gave really good feedback. 

There was one girl who wrote a really freaking amazing screenplay and it was all dialogue, and the dialogue was exciting, her dialogue was about the financial industry but she was able to make it sexy. AaronSworkin was automatically like, you will be successful in this industry. And to be honest, he was completely right, her script was amazing, i mean in the first 5 pages a general audience member is HOOKED.

One guy wrote this super stylized action screenplay where a Action Hero type guy was defusing a bomb on an airplane. It was like a film in the style of ""Crank"" with Jason Statham.

And Aaron kind of tore this guy's screenplay apart.

Sooo my question is ... are action screenplays just not representative of your writing talent. Is it too easy to just write an action screenplay where the characters are kind of One Note... but the film relies on set pieces... like Mission Impossible, Fast the Furious, Transporter, etc.

should new screen writers trying to break into the industry, stop focusing on action heros and set pieces?

but then again a guy like Taylor Sheridan who made a career from the blacklist because his set pieces were soo good. I'm talking about Sicaro and the border scene."

Screenwriting,A question about writers rights,"Hi guys,
So I recently wrote a short film with a colleague. The story was entirely of my creation- the characters, the tone, the plot/storyline, and some specific lines. It is very personal to me and very much lives in my voice.  I am a first time writer and asked this person if they would write with me because they're experienced.

I sent an outline of the story and they came back with pretty much copy and paste what I wrote except in proper screenwriting format and a small handful (less than a page) of dialogue. I was, of course, incredibly grateful.

Its been about 2 months since then and in that time I have written 5 more pages on my own (the script is 11 pages), and continually edit the script. I try to get feedback or engagement from this colleague, to have meetings, and am left with little response, no creative input, no opinions and no assistance. 

The script is being funded and a team is being pulled together- all because of my creating a mood board, a logline, a poster, and reaching out to people. I've been the one pulling most everything together and pitching the project. Its my voice, my story. But I said we would be co-writers those months back when they re-formatted my outline into script format. 

Now I feel upset because I feel like they haven't contributed hardly at all (without my lack of trying) and I, selfishly, dont want to share the title of writer with them. What do I do? How do I go about talking to them about this?"

I started screenwriting in the beginning of this year. After finishing my first screenplay, around March, I sent it to a screenwriter who gives paid feedback for an accessible price on fiverr and actually got a pretty good, complete analysis of my script.
However, I've noticed a lot of people on this subreddit saying that paid feedback is usually not worth it, and as I kept on writing shorts and features, I've also realized that it's impossible to actually pay for feedback every time I write something important.
This leads me to my question: how can someone with no connections in the industry get good feedback? I know that there are subreddits where you can ask people to read your screenplay and give their opinions, but those are usually incomplete and not too useful. What are some good alternatives? Are there any good websites where screenwriters can share their scripts and get them read? Or do I need to go out and make more writer friends? Thanks for reading :)"

Screenwriting,First Generation Chinese Character Accent — Yes or No?,"There's a set of first generation Chinese parents in my script (sort of like Appa/Umma from Kim's Convenience). I'm struggling about whether or not to write the dialogue in accented English. When I refer to ""accented English,"" I don't necessarily mean replacing ""r"" with ""l"" or other pronunciation-based things, but rather differences in phrasing/grammar slips that non-native speakers often have (e.g. saying ""You almost miss flight"" instead of ""You almost missed the flight""). 

On one hand, using accented English would, for me, feel like a more accurate portrayal of the characters. They're based on my own Chinese parents, who spoke accented English, and having them speak like a completely native English speaker, to me, would feel kind of unnatural/inauthentic.

On the other hand, it could be seen as perpetuating the harmful stereotype that ""all Asians have bad grammar."" Just because my parents spoke like this doesn't mean everyone does, and I'm afraid that doing so would play into the long, fraught history of caricature-izing Asian characters. And also, another added layer of concern comes with the fact that the actors would probably be non-first generation/native English speakers (similar to the actors who play Appa/Umma in Kim's Convenience), and thus would be using an accent that's not their own natural one. 

Would love to hear folks' thoughts! Cheers!"

Screenwriting,The more I write the more I realise how hard writing actually is.,"I've been writing for the past five years and have yet to truly complete anything. I found that the more I learned and the better I got the less happy I became with what I was producing. At first it was just getting rid of excess lines or scenes, then it became about giving the necessary parts some deeper meaning and relevance. Then I had to make these necessary parts clever and original but also tie in with the theme and the symbolism of the piece I was writing. For the last two years at least, it takes me months just to flesh out an idea, only to find that many of them don't work because of consistency problems or there isn't enough weight to it to carry a feature, or it isn't different enough from the reference sources I'm drawing from, which means months of working for little or no marketable produce. When I started I could finish a feature in a week! 

I just realised how negative this post sounds but it wasn't meant as such, I just wanted to remark at how truly difficult it is to come up with something new and compelling and perhaps ask if anyone has tips on avoiding trying to be a pseudo perfectionist about whatever you are writing? Or to put it better, when is the right time to STOP writing a particular thing??

Edit: Wow thank you so much for all the tips, methods, philosophies and books!

An abstract horror I wrote for a short that I plan to film, maybe, in the near future.  Just need to know how you guys feel about the imagery, and the dialogue. Does it feel evocative, or contained? Did you feel the characters' reality, and did the story move you? Rip it apart.

Screenwriting,How do you deal with losing faith in a project? Especially when you see it's been done by someone else with way more money than your status as a writer is likely to afford?,"Hey, new writer here. I'm having one of those days where I'm realizing that my 'awesome idea' for a tv series is basically already being done and being done using way more money than anyone will ever put into my script because I'm a nobody.    
Does anyone else ever want to give up their sci-fi project because say, Marvel, is already doing it and doing it better? Do you ever worry you're just so attached to your crazy idea that it's just blocking you from realizing it can't happen and if you don't let it go, you'll waste a lot of your life or time or energy pursuing something that is just going to get rejected and never come to fruition no matter how much you believe in it?  
I've gotten a lot of flack from people lately about the feasibility of my scripts in terms of budget because I'm writing sci fi and fantasy. And I've always believed that these are the kinds of stories people want to see. And I've always tried to just forget about budgets because I'm a writer and my job is to tell stories and not let that block me from writing. But then you're like, here's the actual reality.  
I am not writing for Disney, I'm just starting out and the chances of someone making it are slim or are totally dependent on me being way further ahead in my career.

Even if I can write dialogue that is just as good, even if I can conceive of and work in elaborate storyworlds, even if I'm talented, it doesn't matter because I'm just one of thousands of talented people who will never ever get the opportunity to put that idea out there and see it come to life. I'm not connected, I have no idea where to start, or if it's worth it. I'm not afraid of hard work and I love a challenge, but what if it's just futile? What if that's just a childhood dream that can never really happen, even if do everything right? How does everyone else handle the realization that a piece or project you love or possibly even your career will probably never get published/made/be successful?"

Screenwriting,How can I avoid the White Savior Trope when I include a male white protagonist with a female lead of Arabic origins?,"I am currently writing stories (I jump back from story to story (unhealthily)) and hope to be an author/screenwriter. There is this story like Indiana Jones set in the 1920’s that I have been working on for quite some time. It includes characters of different backgrounds and cultures (albeit, a majority of the characters are white, but there are characters of different ethnicities that are not defined by their background or cultures, but by their actions and unique personalities that are not motivated by the stereotypes revolved around their race, but by their person). These characters would travel around the world and explore different themes. While going over Muslim Representation, I came across an idea to change one of the female leads from a white, English brunette, to a English hijabi of Arabic origins (a “hijabi” is a person who wears a hijab). Her background is that she was an orphan whose real parents were Arabic (where in a Arabia is unknown). She was bullied in school in England by white girls for her background and for not wearing a hijab since it is required for her kind to wear one. (This is not true in Islam. To force a women to wear a hijab is haram (forbidden). Muslim women choose to wear whatever they want, but the hijab is not only religious, but also cultural, since it shows modesty towards others and prevents unwanted attention that could lead men into lust. *Disclaimer* everything that I provided is based off of the knowledge I gained for myself and not from personal experience. I apologize for any mistakes that I may have listed). She undergone years of bullying and felt ashamed of her ethnicity. But then she decided to embrace her heritage and braves racism by wearing a hijab and modest western clothing (it’s a mix between female and male garments, like a female shirt and male pants). She also follows some Arabic customs, like not drinking alcohol (drinking alcohol is prohibited in Islam, but is not followed by more liberal cultures), and not touching the opposite sex. When she was confronted by a senior lady, the lady told her, “Darling… this is England. You don’t have to wear that (hijab) here.” The female lead explained that wearing the hijab was her choice and that no one forced her to wear it. She also explained what the hijab meant for her. After the lady realized her mistake, the female lead would say, “Instead of asking me if I feel oppressed by my hijab, you should ask yourself if you feel oppressed by my hijab.”

I think it would be a great opportunity to include a Arabic character in a leading role who is not oppressed in wearing a hijab, but instead proud in wearing one and is proud of her background and culture. However, when putting the character with the male, white protagonist; I fear that I may result getting into the “white savior” and anti-Muslim trope-- being a white, Christian writer. I recently watched a video about anti-Muslim tropes. Two of the examples include the Apple TV+ show Hala and the Netflix show Elite. Both of them include Muslim character(s) who are being oppressed by their hijabs and are needing liberation. This “liberation” is provided by white saviors in shining armor. This would usually end up with them taking off their hijab in front of others and wearing immodest clothing (Elite). (I am not denying the fact that there are Muslim women who are being oppressed by others and are forced to wear a hijab, it’s just that we are not seeing the other perspective of the hijab and we’re only getting the oppressed hijabi). This is problematic, because my dark skinned English/Arabic hijabi female lead will be paired with my white male protagonist. I am fearful that I would fall into tropes mentioned with the pairing of my two characters who would eventually fall in love with each other (it is “considered” haram for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man, so I decided to make the female lead non-Muslim). I came up with some solutions and scenarios that will counter these two negative tropes. One, the protagonist is not saving the female lead from her devotion to her Arabic or oppressiveness (even though there is none). There are times when the protagonist doesn’t “save” the female lead, because she saves herself on her own. He respects her independence and devotion to her culture. Whenever he is around her, he drinks water instead of alcohol. When they greet each other in public, he respects her space and doesn’t touch her (there are times when they do touch, but the reasoning will be justified). And when they do fall in love and get married, the male protagonist doesn’t force her to take off the hijab or do anything against her culture, he celebrates the differences they have and protects her way of life. For example, when the female lead doesn’t have her hijab on and a male friend comes in, the protagonist pivots himself between her and the male friend so that she could put on her hijab in private and not reveal her hair.

I try to be self-conscious of my actions when I tell stories about other peoples and cultures that are not my own. Is everything that I have listed make sense about the tropes make sense? Is there anything that I got wrong about the hijab or left out? What do you think of a hijabi lead in a adventure blockbuster novel? What are your thoughts on the relationship between the white protagonist and the female lead? Is their relationship a subject of the “white savior” and “anti-Muslim” tropes? Any other thoughts?

Screenwriting,"Hi, I won the 2020 Slamdance Screenwriting Competition with my script OUR GODS WITHIN. I'm willing to talk to ANYONE about ANYTHING regarding writing, production, etc...","Hey r/Screenwriting

I'm a writer/director/producer and member of the WGA Independent Writer's Caucus. Recently, I wrote a script entitled OUR GODS WITHIN, which won the 2020 Slamdance Screenwriting Competition (... and has gone onto to place in other competitions and film festivals).  It's an intimate drama splashed against a sci-fi backdrop. *It tells the story of an ailing wife who struggles to care for her dying husband after he contacts a space-borne illness while working on a decommissioned space elevator that bankrupted their small town.* I like to think it's AMOUR meets ANNIHILATION.

You can view the pitch reel I cut here: https://vimeo.com/435191506

I originally wrote this screenplay with the intention of directing and never intended to really submit to competitions/festivals... *until covid hit*. So, truthfully it was a surprise when it did so well at Slamdance, especially since I understand it's not everyone's cup of tea. I'm very appreciative to them and can't recommend submitting to their competition enough. They're GREAT and very much worth the entry fee. That win lead to reads and meetings that would've never happened otherwise.

That being said, I wanted to post my project on this sub because I think it's a great resource for writers of all levels. Currently, I'm pitching the project and am working to attach talent, above and below the line. I'm also working with two producers who have helped finance two theatrically released indie features, but **I'm willing to talk to anyone ABOUT anything** **regarding the script** (... or writing, production, etc. in general). I've been at it for almost 15 years now and in that time I've learned a lot, and although i'm not the most successful or talented writer in this sub, the biggest lesson I've learned  is that *every writer should take their craft in their own hands and learn to produce.* You really have to put skin in the game to set yourself apart in this industry because there are literally **millions** of other writers screaming into the Hollywood void. Invest in yourself - no one else is going to do it for you.

Screenwriting,Would like feedback for screenplay (127 pages) - First Draft.,"Had begun writing this script in October; finished at the start of February. It took a lot of work, and longer than I thought it would (its my first attempt at a feature length script).

I find this film is almost something like a neo-western (but the main characters are a complete inversion of typical western-type characters) with a similarly vast landscape environment, but, here, in the country of Scotland (which I may not have pointed out in the script; the imagery at certain parts is inspired by Glencoe, a region in Scotland). And so for genre, something like adventure/thriller/drama/western. If the film seems dream-like at parts that’s intentional (but it’s not as crazy or abstract as Eraserhead for I wanted events to still for the most part feel real and not seem pretentious).

The driving plot is this: a young boy runs away from a damaging home in search of a new home. He journeys first with a man who seems just like him (it is his childhood home they are going to) before they are split up and he journeys with another (almost like a complete opposite of the first) who takes him the rest of the way; the boy doesn’t know that this second man  intends to kill the first.

The films core in simplified form is this: the boys fear of growing up, his aversion from life (approaching adult life) which he cannot avoid. Of course things branch out more from this one thing, but this is the heart which they all sprout from, beginning and ending with this.

In terms of what has inspired me (and some of what I’m generally into, so that one knows what they’re getting into here) would be things like Fellini, Lynch (specifically Eraserhead), Tarkovsky (especially Mirror and Stalker), the films of Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Paul Thomas Anderson (especially There Will be Blood) and a whole bunch of others, but these I’ve named have been most influential for me and (probably) this film. The book Blood Meridian however probably influenced this film most; the second I finished it I re-read it, and this was only a few weeks before I began writing this.

Screenwriting,Question Regarding 30 Minute Pilots,"I'm currently working on a 30 minute animated comedy pilot, and had a few general questions regarding formatting. 

I was reading a Rick and Morty [script](https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/uploads/scripts/rick-and-morty-206-the-ricks-must-be-crazy-2014.pdf) for reference, and it only contains 2 acts. I know Dan Harmon's circle story probably takes precedent over a traditional three act story for the writers over there, so I suppose it makes sense. However, I feel like my script follows a similar structure, with not much to cover in act three. 

So my question is, would I look like a total amateur if I only included a 0-3 page act three? Is this something that should be avoided unless working on an established series? 

My current thoughts are that I should just write whatever the hell I want; but from a professional standpoint I think it would be important for me to know, in the case that I decide to ever put this out there I don't look like a total idiot.

I don't expect to be paid anything close to the minimum rate. However, I like what they do and I'm excited about the work (this would be my first freelance writing gig). I just want to make sure I don't rip myself off too much.

The deal is that I'm only paid for tangible work. I can either pitch an idea to them or develop an idea they assign to me. If I pitch an idea and they don't like it, I don't get paid. If they like my idea or want to assign me to work on one of theirs, I get paid. To begin with, I intend to stick to assignments only.

To try and lessen the risk of getting ripped off or dropped from a project, I'd like to break down the fees as much as possible and ideally be paid along the way, or a 50% up front, 50% on completion deal.Should I charge by the document, by the page, per draft? Should certain documents be worth more than others? Should I assume that they would keep the rights if they wanted to develop one of my ideas?  Should I expect to charge a buyout fee if so?

I had a weekly and hourly rate in mind before learning that I would only be paid for tangible work, and I'm struggling to know how best to translate that fee. I don't yet know their predicted project lengths, how many rewrites they would expect or whether I would be the sole writer on a given project.

Any advice on negotiating any of this would be really appreciated."

But I feel like I should at least look at it and organize it somehow into a direction. 

I did begin an outline of an idea yesterday. Now I just want to plot out scenes for this idea and not even write dialogue or anything. Whereas before I was writing dialogue without an outline and it felt like I was flailing around without direction and getting nowhere. I don’t know what I am looking to hear as far as advice, I just wanted to vent and perhaps see if anyone can offer ideas as to how to be able to organize my writing process (I hate that phrase).

Screenwriting,The difference Between writing Blocking and Actions in a script.,"Hello everyone,

I've recently seen a post talking about this subject on how to distinguish blocking and actions in writing.

By ""Blocking"" I mean writing something like ""Dan looks up"". Which doesn't give any emotional information to the script. Is it correct to write ""Dan looks up""? 

Could some of you that might know the difference please explain it as a rule, for example that it's better to use only a certain kind of action verbs or as an example by giving the wrong and good way of doing it.

Thank you all!

Screenwriting,"""She-Hulk"" - An unofficial fan project.","First and most importantly:  This is an unofficial fan-made project, and I have no connection to Marvel Studios nor do I have any knowledge of the upcoming streaming She-Hulk show, or any other upcoming Marvel project.  Any similarity that this script may have to upcoming Marvel properties are purely coincidental and I do not claim any rights to ownership of anything made by Marvel.

This was a feature script that I wrote a couple of years ago as basically a proof-of-concept writing sample to show that I could write a film that could fit within a pre-made film universe tonally and in terms of integration with existing lore.  I used some storylines from the She-Hulk comics to build a film origin story for her, and again, I claim no ownership of any of those characters or storylines, this is a fan-made adaptation.  Think of this as like a TV spec script of an existing show.

At the time that I wrote this (around the release of ""Avengers: Infinity War"") I had no idea that Marvel was planning a She-Hulk TV series and I really just chose the character because she was always one of my favorites in the comics, and I wanted to write a character who had never been adapted yet.  I updated this script after the release of ""Avengers: Endgame"" and changed some things in the story to fit in a post-snap world.  I love Marvel Comics and Superhero films in general and always wanted to write my own feature superhero origin story, and here it is.

I have been sort of sitting on this for awhile as just a writing sample, but no one has offered to read it, so I am just going to leave it here.  I know it is long and does a lot of things wrong, but I still enjoy this script and hope you will enjoy it as well.  

Please offer up any constructive feedback you have.  Thanks.

&gt;  
&gt;"" Hi XXX, We are interested in your story, XXX, and was wondering if it is currently available for option or purchase? If so, do you have a synopsis or treatment that you can share with us? Best, XXX

My gut is XXX might be trying to buy my script and then sell it for even more to a company?

It's a story about minorities, so maybe it's also affirmative action related?

Screenwriting,Revenge theme seems pretty dull,"So I’ve been trying to write this script which has the main character suffering from loosing someone very close to them and using it to fuel their purpose, hence driving the plot. Until suddenly, the fuel starts running out, and not only do I feel that this isn’t enough to drive the character’s actions to the certain level I want it to, but It also seems to have been done to death in many action movies. I tried applying some other elements to drive character and plot, and my story is starting to look like a rip-off of another movie.
What I don’t understand is why they look and tell the same, which is disturbing and making me unable to finish the script. Despite trying to be unique with the premise, I still feel like I’m falling in an ocean of similarities. What would anyone rather suggest?"
Screenwriting,"Very barebones outline for a script I want to write, I feel like it’s not original enough.","Hey folks! Yesterday I started brainstorming a new story that I hope to film and possibly complete this summer, but I feel as if it’s not very original. Here’s a brief summary:

After a heist gone wrong, two criminals escape into the deep woods with a hostage. Arriving at an abandoned home, a failed escape attempt from the hostage alerts a lone police officer who suspiciously makes his way to their location. A suspenseful standoff results deciding the fate of everyone at the scene.

Obviously I’ll add much more detail to each scene to make it more unique. I want to make something that would be very captivating, but at the same time possible for me to make, probably around the 20-30 minute mark. The only problem is I can’t get over how painfully similar it is to Reservoir Dogs in my eyes. I tend to do this with a lot of stories I try to write, always feeling like I’m ripping off something else. Do you guys think this isn’t original enough? Does it sound lame? If so I’ll come up with something else to film this summer. Be brutally honest! Thanks for any advice!!

By way of example, I have a character (a soldier in a POW camp) explain why he plans to abandon his squadron in the prison. It very clearly establishes why he’s about to do what he’s gonna do, where his head is and has been for as long as he’s been a prisoner. But I can’t help but shake my head a little at how on the nose it is. Sorta sounds like something an Anakin Skywalker-type might say, honestly.

To be clear, I mean someone talking about a SPECIFIC script that they wrote, rather than only talking in abstract (""This is what you should have in your outline, this is what you do in the writing"" etc.)."
Screenwriting,What's your take on Nightcrawler's Formatting?,"Dan Gilroy in writing Nightcrawler forewent the classic int. / ext. scene headings found in traditional screenwriting and instead uses his scene headings to focus the reader on specific elements, whether that be ""LOUIS 'LOU' BLOOM"", a ""CHUNKY WATCH"", or (occasionally) the more traditional ""INSIDE THE OFFICE"" - but written out and not ""INT. Office"". 

Personally I love the film and found the screenplay a really great read, thanks not only to the great story but also to the flow and readability of it due to this unconventional nature. I know that other screenplays employ this device on occasion, but I don't know of any others that use it through the scripts entirety. 

What's your take on this? 

An exception that proves the rule? Or something that we might see more of going forward?

I am about to turn 28 and I can't take being alive anymore. I moved to LA to follow a dream but all that happened in the 8 years I've been here is my family members aged, died, watched me fail from 3K miles away, wasted money sending me Trader Joe's gift cards so I don't starve, and I don't want to be alive anymore.

I remember seeing some tweets from Jim Cummings a while back about turning scripts into podcasts, so I did that as a way to get my script out there.

It also features music, sound effects and voice actors.

Just curious if anyone else has done this and if you had any success with it?

What’s some of the most overused tropes in your opinion? Especially re romantic movies circa early 2000s.
Obviously I don’t want to make it too on the nose, more it just passes as atypical and fitting the Hollywood mould.
Also any over recurring side characters would also be helpful"

Screenwriting,Question on ages/character descriptions,"When do you put the age in the character description?

My instinct is: Always, for speaking, named characters, unless the CHARACTER NAME itself is a description/job title, like ""POLICE OFFICER."" But I'm currently working for an author who dislikes the slightest change made during conversion from source material to script. I did not anticipate ""JOHN (16; loner in the neighborhood)"" being a problem. Lo and behold...

Am I overthinking this? Will a producer care if I write a SARAH without age? What if the context (like an office space, or to get more narrow, a middle school)  implies a certain age range?"

Title: Reign of the Dread King

Genre: horror/drama/fantasy

Page count: 32

Overview: 70 years after the mysterious malevolent entity known as The Dread King killed The Old God and annihilated most of the known world, the last safe haven of the humans, elves, dwarves and other living races is a gothic city-state known as Felsharp. Felsharp is protected by massive walls with godlike power. The price for this protection is steep, however, calling for nightly sacrifices. Are the walls meant to keep The Dread King out or keep the last living races in?

Screenwriting,Insight into how I pitched an adaptation of a YA book series as a movie.,"Hey everyone,

This is from a few weeks ago but someone mentioned it would be good to post about here as well. After our film SEARCHING came out and was a hit, we got asked by tons of studios and companies if we would consider writing a movie version of a number of novels, books, foreign films, etc. But my writing partner and I were far more interested in generating our own material at least for the time being. 

There was however one favorite IP of mine that I've always wanted to see come to life as a movie or TV series. And that IP is the 1990's YA book series ANIMORPHS by authors KA Applegate and Michael Grant. But the rights had been caught up for decades, so I never gave it any thought.

I eventually had a chance to meet the authors, and they encouraged me to meet with the producers who hold the rights to ANIMORPHS. In that meeting, the producers surprised me with the news that they were actually about to make a movie, and in that same meeting offered me the job to adapt it. I turned it down due to being so busy writing my next script with Aneesh, and the dozen other projects I'm producing. But a few months later I changed my mind when they were out to a number of writers to present pitches, and we decided to throw our hat in the ring as well -- not knowing how the f we would manage to find time to write it.

We didn't land the job which, but a few weeks ago author Michael Grant revealed I was a writer who had pitched on it. I was asked about it on twitter and finally posted a thread revealing a bit of insight into our process. 

Here is that thread that breaks down our approach in our pitch:
https://twitter.com/SevOhanian/status/1393234311331991553


And u/ibid-11962 was kind enough to [post an entire transcript of it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animorphs/comments/ncform/sev_ohanian_the_writer_michael_grant_wanted_for/) as well.

I’ve been developing various plots and ideas pretty much my whole life and written several scripts over the past four years. I love storytelling in general. Sometimes it’s the only thing that keeps me going. But I digress. The point is, this script, which I will begin writing in September, will be a chance to put my best work out there. An opportunity for me to introduce one of my passion projects to the world. I know it’s not going to be easy. I could really use some advice on how to get it right. I’ve written scripts before but never anything as big as this. Plus my lecturers informed me that I’ll be working with professional screenwriters during the development of this script; experts in the field. I’m thrilled, but I also want to make sure I don’t let it go to my head. The last thing i want is to get carried away and end up writing an awful script as a result.

Screenwriting,"At any screenwriting stage, you are ready to pitch your script? (screenwriting workflow)","Hi,   
when writing a film script you have a risk to put huge time &amp; effort into building your story world &amp; filling pages with events and dialogue, then you might finally discover that producers and your friends don't like your film and no one will be encouraged to produce or watch it. You probably nailed the structure, designed great events, and wrote the fascinating dialogue but you have a problem with more primitive elements like Premise, theme, settings, the story world, the meaning, the society you live in, the state politics, sometimes the budget..., for such things, you need to have a final decision and approval before going with the other elements like events, characters, and dialogue.     
In film post-production, there is an efficient workflow that divides it into stages: rough cut, final cut, conform, VFX, color grading...etc that guarantees that anyone working in post-production (ex. colorist or VFX artist) will not lose huge time &amp; effort working on a shot that will be removed because with the final cut, the feedback on the chosen shots is taken from the director and the shots are locked.   
So, **what is corresponding in screenwritng that can save wasting months or years of your life?**   
In his book *Story: Style, Structure, Substance, and the Principles of Screenwriting,*  Robert McKee suggests the following:   
1. step outline: outline of each scene in one or two sentence  
2. pitching this outline to friends by meeting them &amp; telling the story to them then watching their reactions to it. Now you can know if your story works or not   
3. Treatment: Mckee suggests a long treatment including detailed description and  subtext but without dialogue  
4. screenplay   


I think it is good, but I still have questions:   
1. **Is it okay to officially pitch your script to a producer after the treatment?**   
2. with No.2, I can't trust my friends' opinions to judge a film script. many of them admit they are not experienced enough to be trusted. some movies have been selected or won in top major festivals and I am sure, if I were the screenwriter of one of these movies and pitched its step outline to my friends, they would not like it.   
  I didn't go to film school. so, at this moment,  most of my friends are not filmmakers. even my friends who are filmmakers are at the entry-level in this career like me. the treatment Mckee suggests is really daunting. stage 3 consumes more effort than stage 4 which will be just adding the dialogue.   **So,  I need to listen to a trustworthy opinion before going with the treatment: experienced producers, directors, or critics. How can I do this?**"

Screenwriting,can I actually make a livelihood by being a screenwriter?,"I’m an 18-year-old who is waiting for my final exam results which will be known this coming Thursday. I have decided to pursue screenwriting as a career. I even wanna learn film studies later.

I’ve told my mom about this a few times, and she just regarded it. But idk why one day, she was like: “Are you really gonna pursue screenwriting as a career? Like is that gonna be your livelihood?”

I’m from a low income family. My mom’s a single parent and the only breadwinner in the family. Well, I’m also working but that’s out of the point. We’ve been saving so I can go the college I wanna go to.

But she just realized that I was serious about being a screenwriter/filmmaker in the future. She suddenly went negative on me saying that doing that is not a livelihood. She said it’s unreasonable and stuff that kinda broke my heart but I’m not gonna share it here.

So, I just wanna clear this. Can I really make a livelihood out of screenwriting? Or is that just a part-time thing?

To give some context: The person I’m writing for doesn’t have a producer or financier yet but they are willing to compensate me for the time I take to write the script. I obviously will have a contract with them incase the script gets picked up and made so I won’t be screwed out of money later.

The scene-

A younger version of my protagonist is offered a job he didn’t intend to receive, and is insulted. This will show his integrity and high standards to portray a likability. It will also contrast with the following scene of a deflated and current state of my protagonist.

Screenwriting,"Why is ""Mother and Son"" such an unexplored theme in movies/ and Tv","Finally got around to watching Room (2015) , and the thing I found most intriguing is the chemistry between Bre Larson and Jacob Tremblay. It's made me realize there are very few movies that explore the theme of ""Mother and Son"".  I want to know why this is such an unexplored theme. To me, it's perplexing becuse It seems like a universal theme, as every male has a mother or at least a mother-type figure in their life, and most mothers usually have a strong relationship with their mom, yet i can't think of that many movies that explore this relationship. Compare that to Mother-daughter movies, Father-son, and Father-daughter movies, where I can name several.

It's even the same for TV, as generally, I think this relationship is rarely explored as well too, as often there are often no episodes that pair the Mom and son character together, and their relationship always seems to be one of indifference more than anything.

First ''The Texans'', a western on which John Milius worked in the late 70's before being replaced by Peckinpah after (who had just suffered a failure with his film Convoy). It has been in possession of producer Al Ruddy since and he spoke about it in 2011, saying he wanted to finally make the film (with a new director obviously), but there's been no news since.

Then ''On the Rocks'', a screenplay upon which Peckinpah worked in the last months of his life. He died before it could be completed but some of his collaborators were apparently trying to make the film with a new director (from what I've read in a New York Times article from 1985).

**Please use a good email, meaning one that you didn't just create for the purpose, one that can be connected to your identity via social media or whatever else.** It doesn't have to be public, it just shouldn't be throwaway. 

After this I will go through a fairly lengthy verification process with you because this person is, as we've all seen, a threat to our privacy. I'm not yet sure what form this will take, but it will involve at least a video recording and official forms of ID.

*If you're not comfortable sharing this information, I respect that, but then I'll ask you not to be part of this. This is a real world matter and we need to be able to trust each other and share information safely, and confidentially.*

I've been here from the start, which I can mark with the police report I filed shortly after the demands to censor criticism began in 2019, and my chief concerns in regards to this community have always been:

1) protecting community's right to critical speech

2) protecting members' right to make that speech anonymously, which is why the dismissal of those subpoenas was so important.

That will remain true for anyone who wants to be part of this discussion. It's likely if you're a victim of this harassment your information is known to the abuser already. I won't be sharing any of it without your express permission, and I have the expectation you will honour that for other participants. 

You may not hear back from me immediately, because I'm going to wait to see what the responses look like, and devise a verification process in the mean time so that everyone involved will be protected.

*If you have* ***not*** *been targeted by this person*, please don't contact this email. This is for people who are directly in harm's way so that we can coordinate. I appreciate your support, but it's time for this subject to stop being about popular outrage, and for it to become a concrete response to criminal harassment."
Screenwriting,Fake kidnapping plot - dramatic choice,"I'm curious about the dramatic difference in a fake kidnapping plot.  A wealthy man's daughter is kidnapped, and a massive ransom is demanded, which he pays.  However, unknown to the cops at the time, the whole kidnapping was a ruse designed to help him ""lose"" a huge sum of money, which he then hides in cryptocurrency.  That way when he divorces his wife, that money won't be available to her.  

What's the dramatic differences between these two choices?:

1. The daughter is not in on it, and thus the rogues he's hired have to actually kidnap her.  

2. The daughter is in on it, and so both she and the rogues have to playact and make it seem real."

The couple hides, violence ensues, and a pizza delivery guy becomes their unlikely ally until the woman's hunger for chaos lands them right in the middle of a crime ring.

The meeting went really well! The Manager said they liked my script, and that they'd send it out to a few a-list celebrity producers. They said to follow up again in two weeks, not to ""be afraid to email them.""

Well, two weeks is coming up tomorrow. I have two questions for those who've been in similar positions:

1) what would you suggest is a good way to word the follow up? 

2) Should I follow-up with their assistant, or them directly?  Or both? My initial contact was with the manager, but then forwarded to their assistant to set up the call.

I am the writer and director and possibly cinematographer (if need be) so i am not worried about taking over others roles or limiting their creative freedom, however when showing it to people who would potentially be interested i want it to seem as professional as possible and though i think that it enhances the script i also want to standardize it in an easily consumable way and i will avoid it if it is considered too ""taboo"" for a script to incorporate a few elements from a shot list for influential scenes. if it is done from time to time where would one include it and furthermore does finale draft have a preset/autofill for it."

Screenwriting,Looking for inspiration or to attract readers? MAKE A CONCEPT TRAILER!,"One of my favorite trailers of all time is for a movie that doesn't exist, [Joe Carnahan's Daredevil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92cVd9HalHs). This was pitched as a hard-R movie take on the character before the Netflix series was ever a possibility.                  
This trailer floored me and inspired me to put work into visually seeing the mood of my own scripts. I just finished a [concept trailer for my script ""Movie Love""](https://twitter.com/BenjaminCrew1/status/1400138176153391109) as I tinker with the 2nd draft and anyone who has read it says the concept trailer immediately drew them into wanting to see the story.               
I needed the inspiration, they needed the enticement.                            
The goal of your story is to be seen on the screen so I tell you that if you are looking for inspiration then make a concept trailer! Seeing something you have written come to life is going to inspire you as much as it attracts others to read your story.              
I cannot recommend it enough if you feel you've hit a roadblock in your story. Let your own creativity inspire more creativity."
Screenwriting,Examples of movie scenes that show good confrontation including wrapping up the confrontation / argument by the end of the scene?, I'm not talking about creating conflict itself like the inciting incident. I'm talking about examples of well-written dialogue where two or more characters have a confrontation / argument. I  have a hard time writing confrontational dialogue that doesn't escalate to the point where they basically kill each other. I don't know how to end an argument in a way that it just ends in that scene and then  the overall conflict is eventually resolved  by the end of the story.
Screenwriting,How do you script characters that are unknown to the story in purpose?,"I want to keep a character hidden from the audience and make him appear in the shadows in his first couple of scenes, do I still have to put his name or do I have to put something else and then reveal who he is? I'm asking this because they say the screenplays will eventually be read by the producers ... so they need to know who we're talking about, right? But when we talk about the story and what I want to show ... i don’t want to show him, the audience will not know who he is, you only see his hand."
Screenwriting,How do I make my MC and team leader naturally bond and respect each other?,"Hi all, I'm looking for ways to have my mc and mentor bond over the course of my story.

A brief incite to their backstories.                                                                                                                            
So my MC is a kind of a street-kid. Grew up mostly by himself, doesn't trust as easily and can be difficult to get along with when push comes to shove. So far he's met a girl his age, his partner, that he takes a mild liking to and will eventually become his love interest. His main goal is to find his parents and ask them why he was ""abandoned"" by them as a child.

Fem partner, well, she wants to become a leader of a squad, after seeing and hearing the MC in action she decides to form one with him but lacks knowledge, experience and teammates. There's also a subplot about her sister but that's not as important right now

The team leader/mentor is a retired vet from a fairly recent war trying her best to live a happy life with her family while fighting off mild PTSD. Through the acts and kind deeds of the MC and his female partner throughout the town she is inspired to take up the mantle of a hero/protector and fight for those who cant defend themselves. While the MC and partner can handle themselves, her ""main goal"" for now, if you want to call it that, is to train them for higher level threats and teach the fem partner the ins and outs of being a leader of a squad. (she's the most experienced so it makes senses she's in charge)

What is a squad?                                                                                                                                              
Imagine the all the members of the justice league or the avengers split into smaller teams, minimum of 5 members + 1 special member, across several islands and landmasses. Super humans living together and keep their town or city safe if you will

How they met?                                                                                                                                                          I'm still working on it but so far the mentor ""attacks"" the MC and partner as a way of testing them, in disguise, learning their strengths, weakness and abilities as best she can before she becomes a hero again. 

How they come around to being allies?                                                                                                            
What I have planned is that all 3 characters team up, this time the mentor reveals herself for real, to take back the town they are living in from the goons of the main big bad. 

Naturally these two would clash as a kid with no rules now has to respond tot he adult in the room. The problem I'm having is how to have them bond naturally and come to respect each other over time.

PS I'll try to explain more as best I can if your interested in more

Thank You :)"

Screenwriting,Have you ever had second thoughts about your story idea after actually completing a full draft?,"I’ve had in my head for several months a story which I felt was very powerful. It’s a dark thriller, bordering on horror, but has a powerful message behind it that is relevant to the world today.

This week, after an unusual surge of energy, I was finally able to complete a full draft, from start to finish. 

But by the time I had finished writing, I was absolutely horrified by what I had written. Even though it came from the heart, I felt this story really was too dark, and I found myself losing faith in it thereafter.

It reminded me of a foreword by Stephen King after he wrote Pet Sematary, shelving it because he was too disturbed by what he had written.

As a newbie here, I wanted to ask more experienced people: have you ever lost faith in your story after actually putting pen to paper and completing it?
More so, do you feel it’s better to stick to what comes from your heart, or is it wise to “numb down” certain aspects to make it more sellable?"

Screenwriting,iPad writing app with integrated outlines,"Hi, everyone. I'm a new member to r/Screenwriting and working on my first script. For past writing projects I've always been big on using detailed outlines. They feel crucial to my organization. Final Draft's beat board and outlining tools fit the bill pretty perfectly...except the Final Draft Mobile app doesn't seem to support any of those features. By all accounts I can find Final Draft Mobile is solely a basic writing/formatting app.

I'd very much prefer to write on an iPad (I barely need a proper laptop anymore for my 9-5), but I want/need some kind of integrated outlining system as opposed to jumping back and forth between Final Draft Mobile and a 3rd party outlining app.

I've been playing around a bit with Arc Studio Pro, which has some features I like well enough, but $70-$100 for something I might have to ultimately export to Final Draft anyway seems annoyingly expensive.

Does this mean anything and/or is this actually significant?","Fresh off of a scathing 2/10 review on The Blacklist, my screenplay ""Wastman's Fun Camp"" has officially received its feedback and evaluation that I added on to my submission to the Screencraft Comedy Screenplay Competition. It did quite well, for what it's worth. In fact, after this one evaluation I now have a badge that shows it as being in the ""Top 35% of discoverable projects on Coverfly."" So, to me this *seems* like a very good and significant thing, but is it actually? I'm not quite sure what it means or if it gives me a leg up or a boost in any way that I otherwise would not have? Anybody have any experience with this?

Also, as a side note, I sure am glad I got feedback from both The Black List *and* Screencraft. Had I just gotten my feedback from just The Black List and put all my stock in it, I would probably be considering giving up screenwriting altogether. The Black List *hated* it, so I assumed all others would, too. But what ended up happening is all of the things The Black List reader singled out as their least favorite/most bad/worst parts are the exact things the Screencraft reader said were its strengths and highlights. Fiction sure is subjective, huh?

*EDIT*

I don’t think I did well and I don’t think this ranking will ultimately do me any good. I should not have sounded so proud of myself in my original post and I apologize if anybody interpreted it that way. I was just simply trying to gauge whether or not Coverfly or Screencraft are held in high esteem. I recognize now that being top 35% is meaningless and basically the same as getting a 1/10 and nothing for me to feel good about. Thank you for all of your insights and comments."
Screenwriting,"After years of writing and submitting and waiting and hoping, I FINALLY got to pitch at a major studio","I’ve always appreciated people taking the time to share here how they achieved their successes, big and small, so I thought I’d do the same!

You’ll notice that this is a story of doing a ton of grunt work, of making work independently, again and again — until things finally fell into place once I followed the sage advice of “make the project you’re passionate about.”

First, what was the pitch opportunity?

I pitched for a division of a major studio purchased/owned by the house of mouse. It was for an anthology project so they were looking for new ideas/concepts around a central theme/topic. I pitched three concepts.

Now, some backstory. I’m a writer/director based in NYC. My work explores queer themes and features vulnerable protagonists struggling to be their authentic selves. I’ve been a Sundance second-rounder, a WeScreenplay shortlisted finalist, and made SF and QF in a handful of other screenwriting competitions. But I also make work independently. Right after college I made a feature-length documentary that started in my dorm room and ended up winning awards at festivals around the world and then getting a distribution deal (I have many thoughts on the distribution deal but that’s a topic for another time). After the documentary, a friend of mine asked me to direct a short comedy he wrote. That comedy also ended up doing well at festivals and the writer is currently developing it into a series.

But I wanted to do a project for ME. So I did a ton of soul searching and brainstorming for my own unique voice, what I wanted to say, etc.

I’m a huge sci-fi fan and also a queer person, so I decided to combine them. I built a sci-fi world based on real-life queer history. I worked on the project a ton (a pilot version, a feature version, and many short film versions) and ended up with a short script I intended to make.

Then covid happened…

So during quarantine, we decided to shoot a single scene with a skeleton crew. I rewrote it so it could stand on its own. I paid for it out of pocket. I edited it myself. I’d been learning Blender, so I made this my first massive attempt at doing my own 3D graphics. It felt like a full-circle moment, just like when I first started making films as a teenager. Back then I was alone in my room writing stories about aliens and learning After Effects. Now I’m alone in my room because of a pandemic and learning Blender. Most importantly, though, I was having fun. It felt like the project embodied ME.

When I finished the edit/VFX, I was surprised, tbh. It was better than I expected. It turned out so well, we submitted it to film festivals as its own short, called Friend of Sophia ([trailer](https://youtu.be/V71pKQN-sTc) if you’re interested). Great, so now time to plan to fundraise for the full short.

But then...

Remember all those festivals that my last two films played at? Well one of those festivals apparently had a list. And this studio reached out to the festival, looking for up-and-coming filmmakers from the festival circuit. So the festival asked if I wanted them to submit me. Uh, duh. They asked for screeners of my prior work, including Friend of Sophia, which they saw just premiered at a festival.

Because I made this sci-fi project, I got asked to pitch to the studio.

I can’t say specifically what I was submitting for, but it was a PERFECT fit for me and what I want to do. I’d always dreamed of having to binge-watch a show before a meeting, and that’s what I did. It was a literal dream come true, but in this case, it didn’t feel scary. It felt fun.

I studied their brief of what they were looking for pitch-wise. I had projects already outlined that I could adjust for the pitch. The third I made up based on the prompt.

I put three pitches together and practiced like crazy. I recorded myself, watched the recordings (ugh), revised the pitches, and repeated. I practiced with two friends of mine. One who worked in development in LA, and one who is based in NYC and recently went around town in LA with a pitch of his. They both gave me very different notes from different POVs.

I revised the pitch and practiced again with the development friend. I told him to ask really difficult story questions, really tear into the pitch so I can practice needing to be on my toes. He said that’s unlikely. What’s more likely is that you’ll pitch and then get a blank face and a thank you.

What ended up happening was a little bit of both. I practiced my pitch so much I was super comfortable. I had the floor for 15, 20 minutes. And their reactions gave me nothing. There was an assistant in the zoom call and she laughed at all the jokes I put in there, so at least I knew I was performing well! I was a bit worried they weren’t into it. But when we started a Q&amp;A, I realized they were deep in thought. You know when you show someone a piece of writing and they ask the ONE thing that is like your weak spot? They did that. A lot. I didn’t have the best answers to all their questions, they’d reflect, and prod again. I could tell they knew story.

The two pitches based on ideas I was already developing they didn’t like. The third one clicked with them though. Based on that, they asked me to revise the pitch deck I put together and send it back to them. So I did!

I’m still waiting to hear back from them. Honestly I have zero expectations. I’m just so happy I had my first pitch! It’s like ripping a band-aid off.

Some things that I learned: I should have been much more intentional about ice-breaker conversation at the top of the meeting. I did a lot more of that at the end of the meeting and everyone opened up a ton, so it would have been helpful at the beginning. I took the advice from a friend not to be too like “thank you, I’m a big fan of \[redacted\]” at the beginning. I closed with that and, again, they responded well to it. So if I could do it all again, I’d ask ice-breaker conversations about covid/reopening/summer/whatever, then talk about how much I enjoy the thing they made.

So yeah. Hope that’s helpful to someone out there and encourages you to keep going!

**TLDR**; all the years of work I thought weren’t taking me far enough turned out to be a necessary backlog of work to get noticed. I keep seeing advice to make the film that you’re passionate about. And like clockwork, as soon as I did that, things fell into place.

Screenwriting,I finished 60 one-page scripts in 60 days! (Thanks to u/EphiXorE for the challenge!),"This is an exact response to this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/mblmww/hey\_everyone\_i\_started\_a\_challenge\_called\_the\_60/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/mblmww/hey_everyone_i_started_a_challenge_called_the_60/)

Hi all! First timer here. I usually lurk or I'm not confident enough to share my scripts online, but I felt so proud of myself being able to write 60 scripts in a few months that I wanted to share my progress.

A massive thanks to u/EphiXorE ([Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/dewiedasmapfel96) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/f8CW779c)) for creating the challenge: 

**Write 60 ONE-PAGE scripts in 60 days.**

It was VERY difficult for me. In all honesty, I did miss some days (you'll see the evidence in the document) due to no time, work, personal issues, etc. but I never realised how much I actually liked writing until I pushed myself like this.

&amp;#x200B;

The overview is a small document I wrote for myself to better arrange each script so that I'd cover many genres, many settings, character types, etc. I wanted to be as *diverse* as possible. I also added a small tier list for myself so I could recommend my favourites to those that don't have time to read all 60. E.g.

I was told this subreddit is a great place to share scripts so any feedback would be highly appreciated! Short or detailed, one script or all *(though you're a legend if you read them all)*. My number one goal is to improve my writing.

Screenwriting,Before your very eyes.,"There is no escaping the fact that at some point you and you alone will have to face the page and write. 

I can spend an incredible amount of time in a state of anxiety, worry and fear prior to a writing session. This can go on for days, weeks or even months if I let it. The longer the gaps inbetween the stronger those feelings grow. It's a very visceral feeling which inspires all sorts of self sabotaging, procrastination and life derranging behavior , but eventually I always end up back in front of the blank page when the dam finally breaks and the words gush out. 

What's true is that everyday I am compelled to string words together somewhere. The writers mind can behave like an out of control firehose and one must work to tame it and train it on the fires you've set for yourself before they consume you. 

Left unattended your words will end up everywhere other than where you wish for them to be, in long winded social media posts, notebooks, scraps of paper, notepads on your phone, voice recordings, text messages, blogs, conversations or worst of all, everpresent in your mind driving you mad 

You will write because you can't not write so why not write on what you want to be written? 

It won't always feel good, or easy, or comfortable, or useful, or right, or pleasant. Sometimes you won't even know what the right first word should be. Write the wrong word for now. Start with the second word or the third word. Put in a place holder. Write anything. Write something. Get out of your own way. 

Now imagine if I had used this time and the word count above to further the screenplay I'm working on rather than writing this post. The firehose got away from me again....."

However, I’ve come to the problem that after a year basically sitting in a room, I’ve been having trouble generating new ideas because I’ve become my own worst critic judging whether or not what is actually a good idea or not, leaving me frustrated and depressed since all I want to do is go make something and I feel alone with this problem of generating ideas."

Screenwriting,Mixing up found footage and cinematography,"As previously stated in a post, the script I’m writing is a mix of horror genre and contemplation; I’d say my two biggest influences for it are REC and The Tree of Life if that makes any sense. Ever since I’ve been thinking about this film, I’ve felt like the main story should be in found footage because it’s my favorite way to tell horror, especially body horror; and a more narrative secondary story should be made of three-four cinematographic scenes which relation to the main story is cryptic. I have never seen a movie mixing the two before and wonder if this would be a good idea. 
This is my first screenplay, and I collided agaisnt a wall- it’s turning out complex and I need to know y’all opinion on if this is a good idea or not, if this is worth it. Because I feel like taking away the found footage part of the movie would h like talking away a relevant part of its soul, and taking away the cinematographic scenes would simply decrease the the artistic sense of the movie, as much as the strength of its themes. It would definitely make it a better horror movie, but I’m not sure it’s the story I want to tell."
Screenwriting,Overlooked Story-Type,"In human history, when farming was understood, it was an amazing development: that you did not have to kill or conquer to survive, and instead could grow food. But in those places where it had developed- clearly better than the alternative- it required you stay in one place and be vulnerable to the rest of the world, who only hunted or scavenged. 

The myriads of stories of farmers attempting to demonstrate the new ability- to convey it as favorable, as enabling the marauder to desist and still have their needs taken care of- have not really been told. 

I think it’s a type of story that could have rivaled others, had it developed in literature. It’s a good allegory: having uncovered something significant that others have no conception of… I often wonder how ideas spread in our history: what is accepted? What great ideas fell on deaf ears?"

I blame this dream on the THC and the fact I fell asleep watching “Black Caesar” (1973).

After recording my dream and giving it some thought I realized I want to mix two genres I absolutely love: 

Blaxploitation and Whodunit Mystery!

I think this would be an interesting take on the genre as we’ve seen Neo-Noir Blaxploitation, Western Blaxploitation, Martial Arts Blaxploitation, Outlaw Biker Blaxploitation and many more blend so smoothly.

Screenwriting,How do you get out of the planning/outline stage?,"I've been into screenwriting since I was like 10 years old, so I always have like 100 different ideas bouncing around in my head. Every so often, one will stick out to me and I'll decide to develop it into a script. My problem is that I can never just... *start* writing.

Whenever an interesting concept comes to mind, I start writing an outline before I even go near the 1st draft. I try to write out complete character arcs, break down the plot scene by scene, and essentially have every aspect of the framework planned out before I even type the first letter of the script.

That's all fine and good (it does help keep me from getting lost mid-way through a script), but it often prevents me from actually getting started on a script in the first place. Every time I feel a boost of creative energy, it's immediately squandered by my weird need to meticulously plan everything before I even start writing.

What happens most of the time is I'll have a half-baked idea, I'll excitedly scribble out the details, and then I get stuck trying to fill in the blanks until I inevitably give up on the script before the first draft.

Anyway, I was wondering how you guys push past the ""pre-script"" stages of screenwriting? How do you get yourself to actually get started instead of writing, deleting and rewriting everything a million times? How do you find a good balance between planning and doing?"

I had a few thoughts after Ep 502 of Scriptnotes on what it's like being a teenager and trying your hand at narrative storytelling. The question in this case addressed the apparent lack of break-out screenwriting prodigies, as there are in music, chess, certain kinds of sports, etc.

Well, I was one of those kids who went for it. I'd been writing most of my young life, but when I decided to go to film school directly from high school, I had it in mind I was going to be a director... because I wanted to have the most creative control over my storytelling, and I didn't really grasp that the discipline wasn't aligned to my talents. Also, pro tip, it turns out that fellow students in the 20-50 age range don't really look at an 18 year old as a creative prodigy. Go figure.

If you're 14 years old, 18 might not seem that young, but if you're in your 30s, you know that even a talented 18 year old is still missing so many of the pieces, no matter what her life experience up to that point. No one, absolutely no one, wants to be told ""you'll understand when you're older"" or ""you just aren't good enough/don't know enough yet"".

I want to break this down for you, because there are so many of you now joining this forum who are in your mid to late teens, and this applies for some of you in your early twenties, too (it did for me). So here are some thoughts about how to make the most out of starting early.

**When you introduce yourself, it's always good to acknowledge when you're new and inexperienced, because it signals that you know you have stuff to learn.**

&gt;It's also good to provide some unique insight about yourself and why this attracts you. But here's the thing: no matter how good your high school creative writing teacher says you are, no matter how much effort you put into finishing that first draft, you aren't a genius. You aren't really ahead of the curve. You may have a very good grasp on voice, on pacing, how you convey your story,  but there are life experiences ahead of you that you need in order to be able to do this. This is less about word-prettiness, and more about streamlining universal emotional themes.

**Adversity breeds creativity**

&gt;Many life experiences are traumatic. Early heartbreak, loss, disappointment -- for those of us that are lucky. War and famine are whole other categories -- I know of a writer my age who started life in a bunker under falling bombs, and who learned about film by sneaking into his parents' VHS store upstairs and watching everything in it.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would hope that you don't experience that, or even the other more mundane difficulties, but that's unrealistic. I hope especially that you won't experience them prematurely, but again reality just doesn't care. In fact, early trauma is one of the things that often puts us on the creative path. It is a coping mechanism to take feelings of despair, grief or pain and put them on a page or canvas, anywhere they can do us slightly less harm.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, at least in my experience, there is a tendency for us to get a lot of acknowledgement of the intensity of our creatively expressed pain, and for us to mistake that as an endorsement of our skill. Other people relate to pain, it's the engine of storytelling, but that doesn't make it brilliant or compelling.

**Use your good taste to feed your talent.**

&gt;Here's the good news: for all of us, the [gap between taste and talent is the starting point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91FQKciKfHI). All of us. We all decided we wanted to try this because we saw something we loved, and we wanted to make something that amazing. If you are young, between 14-18, you have a window of opportunity that closes as you get older and are burdened with the responsibilities of supporting yourself and others.  
&gt;  
&gt;What you can do now, and what will absolutely make the difference for you in a few years' time, is consume as much of what you love as possible, and be curious about things you don't know. Scripts have never been easier to find, and reading TV and film scripts alongside their finished form will teach you how to bridge that gap between your taste and your talent. If you listen to the best writers and directors, so many of them had this formative time in their youth to absorb these stories, to really investigate what makes them good.

**Look for free or low cost educational resources you can access right now**

&gt;You also have time to take advantage of creative writing classes in your educational sphere that will, even if they're not screenwriting focused, teach you about what makes the words on the page a pleasure for the reader. Once you know how to do that, you can control the intensity of those words, and shape them so that they do the work they need to in the screenplay format. Passion is visible on the page, even when it's subtle.  
&gt;  
&gt;This will also give you an idea of whether or not you want to continue including these kinds of classes into your further academic career. I won't give you advice on whether or not to go to school for this or that discipline, but if you do go on to college or university, it's never a bad thing to have a few writing workshops or film studies credits in your mix.

**Go make some film**

&gt;And yes, you've got one more tool that you have the time and energy to learn that many of us never had a chance to take advantage of: *make film*. You've still got a lot of flex in your bones, and you can bounce back from mistakes. You've got time and energy to volunteer to other more experienced creators, to learn early, and maybe set yourself up for a day job in the industry. It makes a huge difference in your ability to write a good screenplay if you know how that material is used. It gives you a chance to take your experience past the silent partnership between writers and actors, and it provides you with the ability to distinguish what is or isn't necessary for your script. Even if you're just using an iphone to film coverage of two actors talking to each other, you'll slingshot yourself ahead when it comes to the root composition process.

**Be curious about your world.**

&gt;Life is weird. Life is painful. Life is, on some occasions, wonderful. Part of the reason other writers might be telling you that you ""just aren't there yet"" isn't that they have something you lack that gives them the right to judge -- it's that you are the chief source of your stories. If you want to tell screen stories about experiences you haven't had your main inspiration is going to be... other people's screen stories about experiences you haven't had.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Write what you know"" isn't a rule. **It's a forgone conclusion.** *You're going to do this no matter what*, which means you actively need to seek out experiences in order to increase your knowledge. That doesn't mean you can't be imaginative, or that you can't be sensitive to the problems of taking stories away from others, but it does mean it is your job to be curious about the real world, about real experiences, about human stories happening right now. If you want to write imaginatively in a way that's compelling and honest, you have to listen to the lives of other people.

That's pretty much it -- all the stuff I wish someone had told me as a teenage writer. It's not a pass into the industry, or a guarantee of anything. Talent and voice aren't really something that can be taught, because it is a never ending process of self-instruction -- but I do believe that instruction comes from the practice of every day recognition, and appreciation. Whether you do that actively or passively will make a difference, but as with any discipline, it's like a muscle. If you've got 4-6 extra years out in front, you'll have a stronger voice by the time you've got the ability to actively pursue your ambitions."

LOG LINE- Theodore (Theo) , an old fellow recalls his encounter with an intriguing  woman he met in a town in Santa Cruz county many years prior.

Howdy, I'd highly appreciate it if anyone could read my short screenplay and shit on it. I mean really don't hold back, I live for constructive feedback."
Screenwriting,Reviewer got the wrong country,"I wrote a script about a family in Iran where the main language is in Farsi. The first half of the script is quite literally all about Iranian culture and the second half is about Islamophobia in America after 9/11.

“Iran” is mentioned probably 30+ times in the script.

Even the longline starts with “When a gifted Iranian girl...”

But my Blcklst evaluator wrote that the location was Iraq and mentioned multiple times about how the “Iraqi story..” and “Iraqi characters...”


I know that to people who aren’t West Asian like me, this probably doesn’t seem like a big deal, but the essence of the story is about Iranian culture and islamophobia, and the reviewer got the whole damn country wrong.

It’s like if someone had written a Japanese story and someone said it was a “lovely Chinese script” or something.


I don’t know — I feel like I’m being petty but it’s also kind of insulting that I’m paying $75 for an evaluation and they can’t even name the country that the entire story takes place in.


Is this something I should message support about, or should I just take the review and move on?

Edit: oh man, I was *not* expecting this to blow up. Thank you all for the different perspectives. I’ve emailed Blckst support and am hoping they’ll give me a new evaluation. I’ll keep y’all updated. Thanks again for the support!

UPDATE: Blcklst has offered a free evaluation and a month of hosting. Thanks, everyone! Definitely didn’t expect to get this much traction (let alone getting the man himself involved), but I very much appreciate the support and advice."

Screenwriting,I feel like I ruined my script in the rewrites,"It was the project idea that made me want to get into screenwriting in the first place. It was silly and weird and the only project I worked on for nearly a year. And I ran it into the ground, nearly having the beats commuted to memory. 

I finally gave it a rest in Jan, deciding to work on other projects which I think have potential. Yesterday I reread my first script and OH BOY. Actiok lines I worried were too long and aimless were now minuscule and dry and boring. The humor that I thought was there was flat was overwritten and forced. The plot was stupid and was done better by other shows in recent years.

The silver lining? It got two chuckles out of me. Both in the last six pages or so. And those were two relatively new jokes I put in my script before I stopped working on 

Just wanted to share. I’m unsure if I will come back to this project and see it in a new light. All I do know is that sometimes constant rewriting and editing can make a bad script worse."

This past week or so, however, I just binged Apatow's Love &amp; didn't write hardly anything during that time.

Screenwriting,someone interested in my writing has asked for my rates? Help.,"I'm UK based, just for context.

I've had a filmmaker email me telling me she really likes my script loglines on my website and how one is similar to a project she's looking to make. She's then asked my rates.

A few notes - you can't access my scripts online, just the loglines with a button to contact me. She hasn't said which one she likes, who she is or any of the details. Shall I hold off on rates for now? This is my first actual feedback as a writer so I'm extremely excited and overwhelmed to have positive feedback on my works for the first time in my life, but obviously I need to do a few things from here to make sure things go well.

In regards to my rates, should I give day/hour/project rates? And what rates would you advise? I basically live in poverty rn, so I am not aiming high - in all honesty, if the project seems good, is it worth working for cheap or free to get my foot in the industry? Shall I just enquire about the project first before setting my rates, in case it's bigger or smaller than anticipated?

Also, I've already written first drafts of each of my examples on my website - legally will I be able to make a work similar and then use my own at a later point, or will my script now become their script? 

Sorry for the informal tone, I'm very excited and scatterbrained. Honestly even if nothing comes of it, hearing that someone thinks my work is remotely good is the light at the end of a very long tunnel for me.

Thanks everyone!"

Screenwriting,How Do You Guys Handle Walking Up To/Standing Up/Sitting Down/Looking At/etc.?,"One thing I definitely struggle with is writing my action lines. I can have good, punchy dialogue, and an interesting plot, but my action lines always have people ""walking up"" to others, ""looking at"" each other, etc.

It reads clunky, it gets iterative and boring *very* quickly, and I've been told it's no different from directing the actors. So I'm trying to eliminate them, and improve how I write my action lines. Any ideas for how to make my intentions for my story clearer, and not cause confusion (especially with dialogue) once I take them out? I'm especially concerned about there being lines, and lines, and more lines of dialogue without action if I take away the looks, the walks, etc.

Here are some examples:

\&gt; Jack stands back up, and the pair take a few moments to appreciate their work.

\&gt; Jack walks in, and helps the Man to his feet.

\&gt; Mick walks up to a zombie with a nametag that reads: ""Hello my name is Lenny.""

\&gt; Jack and Staci both look over.

\&gt; Jack tackles the man, and pulls him up.

\&gt; Ford saunters over to her, crouching down to her level.

\&gt; Jack jerks Rick up off the ground, and gives a dirty look to his unhelpful friends.

\&gt; He pauses, and looks to the crowd expectantly...

Screenwriting,Question about description,"Hey everyone, I’m a young screenwriter still learning it all and would love to have this question answered. It isn’t the most complex or difficult question, but it’s about descriptions in a screenplay. On this current screenplay I’m writing, I have a lot of descriptions for scenes, for example it would describe the environment as: Sunny and beautiful. Skies clear and blue. Or another example would be a few lines setting up a room. How needed is this in a screenplay? My job as the screenwriter is to tell the story, create the plot, etc. so how much of my job is to set the scene? Should I hold descriptions to one to two lines or should I completely cut it out since that would come down to the director and production designer? Hope that makes sense and is able to get out to anyone! Thank you to anyone and whoever helps me out 😊"

Obviously, pushing through when you are demotivated is not bad advice, but the general ' just keep writing' when the writer notices something is very wrong is usually pretty bad. I saw people who wrote at the same horrible script for 5 years instead of doing s th else or improving. Better advice would be to find a healthy balance between reflecting on what you are doing and pushing through.

Screenwriting,Script request: Agents of SHIELD and other lore-heavy monster of the week series pilots.,"Can anyone point me to a copy of this script? I've had zero luck finding it online, and I see a 5-year-old post on here where someone requested it and seemingly did not find it.

Anticipating that it's not online to be found, I'd also appreciate any pilots featuring a sort of monster of the week approach set in a universe that is steeped in lore. for example, SHIELD starts after the MCU Phase 1 (plus the decades of comics) and so the viewer comes into it with a lot of outside knowledge that the writers need to account for, if not necessarily address. 

I'm interested in how one dives into such a lore-heavy world, balancing explaining things for novices with doing everything you need to get done in a pilot to hook the reader/viewer. Bonus points for any script that was written on spec or otherwise sold off of the pilot (I'm certain Whedon was gonna get an episode order no matter how much of a slow burn his SHIELD pilot turned out to be)."

The images from both of these examples are what we see in the show, they carry the visual feel and tone of the series. How important is is to have such examples, or can I say something like, ""This animated series carries the visual feel of Bladerunner 2049 and James Cameron's Avatar""?

Screenwriting,Getting noticed when you don't want to - or can't - move to LA,"I posted something last week about getting a rep. Some folks pointed out that simply saying ""move to LA"" is a privileged prespective. Fair enough! I thought I'd write something up about how you might be able to get noticed without moving to LA.

I'm a former exec and working screenwriter who got my first manager while living in a different city, which led to the job I moved out to LA for.

I'm only relaying my personal experience, which is probably different than yours!

Anyway here's what I would suggest (EDIT: not sure how to fix the formatting here, so I'm not going to try)

1. **don't get discouraged**: seriously, if there are no bites or you're getting terrible feedback - do *not* feel bad. Like 99% of writers aren't going to write a great script the first time around. Or the second. Or the third. Maybe the fourth. Keep writing and you *will* get better. And you will find more success. I suspect a lot of you are under 30. I know super successful people and maybe 1-2 of them had anything going before they were 30.
2. **don't** ***just*** **write scripts - produce content**: comedy writer? make a webseries, a parody trailer, or do sketches on tiktok. drama writer? create a 10 episode narrative podcast. want to be a film director? make a short!

and why not shoot one scene from your favorite script as a ""trailer"" for it?

don't have money? shoot something on your iPhone with friends, or record a podcast on your computer.

do have money? reach out to celebrities to star in your personal projects. never hurts to ask and it can help you get noticed. i got a B list celeb for a short film simply by sending him the script. a buddy of mine got an A list voice-actress (not an A list actress, but someone who voices famous characters) to star in his podcast simply by writing a fun email to their reps.

the worst they can say is no! and if you're doing something that's audio-only, the celeb can be anywhere.

3) **be smart about distribution:** study how to title and tag your videos to get the most views. I won't go into it here, but ""AMAZING GUN FIGHT!"" or ""A short film with a twist..."" is going to get more views than ""Joe Smith: a Gangster's Story"" or whatever you title your project.

Also, if you're gonna create social content, jump on hashtag trends to get views. It will help you get noticed.

And why not tag your favorite producers or writers when you create content? Be humble and nice about it, but writing something like ""I'm so inspired by your work, (writer name) I'd love to know what you think of X"" is totally reasonable, and there's a decent chance that a writer who doesn't have a billion followers will see it.

4) **find likeminded friends who want to write and create content**: take a screenwriting class at your local university and find the best writers and invite them to join a writer's group. (or use Reddit!) take a film production class and suggest creating a ""collective"" of crew members who will all work on each other's projects.

it takes a village - you can't do it alone (or it will get very expensive if you're trying to do it alone)

to me, that was the biggest obstacle until I got to LA - no one where I lived took this seriously, and even though I created a ""collective"" with friends, we never shot anything!

5) **blast your scripts out there with contests and query letters - but don't do it until your script is READY:** There was a manager who commented on my last post to say he read query letters. It happens! But it won't happen again if you send a rep a script that isn't ready. The business is harsh and most people won't read a second script from someone who sent an amateur first script.

6) **work on creating your ""voice"" -- and come up with a way to tell commercial ideas with that voice:** successful writers have a clear and distinct voice, so when you start reading a script of theirs, you immediately know it's them. the *most* successful writers figure out a way to use that voice to tell commercial ideas.

You might write a terrific indie drama about your childhood, but that logline won't be as exciting to reps as a 4 quadrant action movie with an amazing twist, that has elements of your personal story sprinkled throughout.

My point is, try to write with an eye towards the business of screenwriting. After you sell that first script, then write the pet project.

Anyway, good luck!"
Screenwriting,How to not feel guilty about writing content/analyzing films?,"I absolutely love cinema and want to make a full career switch directing films eventually (like a decade down the line), but sometimes I feel a bit guilty for spending time to learn about screenwriting/filmmaking because I could be doing something more productive instead (studying/preparing for the career im actually going into atm). Has anyone felt like this (I’m sure many have hahaha), and how do you not feel guilty for spending time on a non-practical passion? It’s not like I’m falling behind in the stuff I’m obligated to do, but with the type of career I‘m pursing atm, the more time I spend on it the better, hence the the bit of guilt lurking in the background whenever I do something film-related.

And honestly, a lot of the ideas weren't bad at all - they were original, clever, and very creative. It's amazing what people come up with when they stop worrying about coming up with a bad idea.

 I came up with a few of my own bad ideas for a script- some people said they  were terrible, but I also had tons of people who thought the ideas were awesome.

 Ironically, when I stopped caring about if people thought my ideas were bad I pitched better, wrote faster, my content was more creative and I was willing to explore. 

In short, we need to stop fearing having a bad idea or being judged by others for not being in ""style""."

Screenwriting,How to make a very long scene? Subdivide?,"It's for my TV show. I have a 12 minute scene where multiple different events and discussions take place. However, there is a temporal continuity. The same characters, in the same place, without interruption. No one comes in, no one goes out, no outside events. Everything in real time!

How do I do this? Should I subdivide this scene anyway? According to whether the characters are busy with one thing or another?"

Screenwriting,Celtx crashed and I lost my file!,"I was working on a file that I didn't save and when I had it finished and went to print it, celtx just crashed and I lost my file, how do I get it back? Is there a recovery feature or something?"
Screenwriting,A PSA about sharing work and etiquette....,"So... After an exchange I had today, I felt compelled to throw out an idea for the community to think about. A reminder, of sorts. 

Obviously, take this with a grain of salt, but... 

Sharing one's work is a vulnerable act. Especially when it is the developmental phase. We know this, and we recognize that is is an important part of what we do... It's crucial in our quest to get better and to help those around us do the same. 

Here's a message I received today from a user on this board (not verbatim): ""***Read a bit of your script. It didn't grab me. Skimmed the rest. Don't feel like giving any feedback, and don't worry about sending any of yours on my script that you've read. Probably shouldn't have sent it anyway, as I never intended a real ""swap"". ""***

Now... Do not think that my issue here is that what he read of my script didn't grab him. While hearing that someone doesn't relate to your work isn't fun, it's an integral part of this process, and we learn to live with it. It's fine. 

Did I LOVE the script of his that I read? No. I liked  a lot about it, and had various issues with aspects of it as well. I was ready and eager to give some honest and constructive thoughts about the good and the bad. That's all we can ever ask for. 

However... To say that ""I'm not going to take the time to give you any degree of feedback"" shows a blatant disrespect for the vulnerability it takes to show someone your material. 

Am I suggesting that you should always be up for giving detailed notes or coverage? No. Of course not. We're all busy. However... If you offer to read something for someone... Something that probably carries with it much emotion for the writer, then just don't be AN ASS. 

**Let's put it more simply: If you offer to read something for someone, do it. If you are not of the mind to want to help in SOME SMALL WAY, then don't offer to.** 

Maybe this is over-thinking on my part to feel compelled to send this message into the universe, but please... If this community is meant to support and help each other through this VERY difficult and at times draining career, let's show some class. 

**LET'S SUPPORT EACH OTHER!**"

Screenwriting,Manager wants my weakest scripts... what to tell her,"Met a manager recently while out socially, and after I pitched a couple ideas, she gave me contact info and asked me to send loglines, so she could send me release forms and read some of my work.  So I sent her 4 loglines, wanting to show that I had a stack of things she could read. 

But she replied and asked for two of them- the weaker two. One of them is a script I actually kind of hate now and didn't expect her to ask for. The two best and most recent ones of course are the ones she did not ask for.  So I am hate-scrolling the worst one to see if it has any hope of not pissing me off, and I already sent the less-bad one.

Screenwriting,hi! I need some advice for a project,"Hi. I'm fairly new here, but I plan to keep this straight to the point.

I'm 19, and I'm writing a 7-piece manuscript for a supposed episodic format. I am currently on the 4 part of the manuscript. I recently saw this show  however and it was a bit similar to my one in a way (in terms of representation of characters and plot) - not saying I hated it - I loved it. But I wonder if anything like this has happened to new screenwriters where they feel they lack originality in their work because of this issue - and I really don't want to be put off writing this project completely because of small things like this. 

But also in terms of the piece I am writing, I wanted to ask any screenwriters on here if they can share some advice on how to adapt material from other influences and incorporate that into your own work. I don't mean making an adaptation of a already published work, but rather referencing elements from older works that came prior.

The piece itself I'm writing is a fiction piece but I feel like changing the tone of my piece from a less serious, dark tone into a more light-heartened tone.  There are shows and media currently that seem to be more serious yet less which seem to show characters in a positive light.

I'm open for feedback, and if you want more details about the manuscript, I'd be happy to share."
Screenwriting,"Any professional screenplays that are just so incredible that they need to be written in unicorn blood, on sheets of golden paper, and preserved in a vault?",All joking aside...are there any incredible screenplays you recommend others read or learn from?

I’m just wondering what other ones out there made you feel the same way?
Screenwriting,How do you make sure your scenes are doing what they need to be doing?,"Possibly sounds a bit silly. I’m just working through the drafts of my script and I am constantly questioning my scenes, going through checklists. For example, is it clear my characters want any thing? What’s standing in the way? Is the conflict there? Is it boring? Etc. What ways do you make sure your scene is doing what it needs to do? Often I find myself moving away from my checklist, letting the scene take me where it wants, but by the time I’ve written and rewritten it, I don’t really know the answers to my own questions."
Screenwriting,Random procedure question about previous AFF procedures,"I am applying to be a reader for this year's AFF competition, and in reading the rules and regulations, I came across the rule that each screenplay needs two ""NOs"" not to move onto the second round. I submitted in 2017 and didn't make the second round, and noticed that I had only summary comments from one reader, which is as it should be, I believe-- but was it also true in 2017 that my script was given a ""NO"" by two readers? Or did it only require one ""NO"" back then? Thanks so much."
Screenwriting,Submitting first-ever screenplay to a screenwriting competition?,"I've gotten mixed feedback about this topic and I wanted to see what everyone thought. I see both sides of the argument, but I'm still unsure what to do. 

I finished my first screenplay two months ago or so. It's a psychological thriller/horror film. I've steadily been working on revisions and I'm on my third and final draft. I can honestly see myself being done by the end of the week. 

I've known about the SCREAMFEST competition for a few months now. The final extended deadline is June 15th. Should I submit my first screenplay in for a competition? Some things I'm obviously considering: 

**PROS:** 

* The screenplay wont just be sitting in a desk gathering dust. I'm actually putting myself out there, which is a bit of a confidence boost. I don't care about winning. 
* Competition provides feedback from well-established readers in the community. 
* I can incorporate the feedback and just the general experience of going into a competition into future projects.

**CONS:**

* This is my first screenplay. It obviously probably sucks. I'm humble enough to admit that. Probably not a good idea going into a competition on my first attempt ever. 
* It's $77 for the submission fee and probably $25ish for WGA Registration. So $100 for a competition I know I'll lose. A lot of people will see that as a waste of money. 
* No way in telling them this is my first attempt. They'll read it and probably think ""Seriously?""

What does everyone think? As stated, I'm not in it to win it. I'm not thinking it's some spectacular gem. I'm more inclined to do it just to further commit myself to writing, put myself out there, and hopefully get some useful feedback. But, there's definitely the cons I stated above. Advice? 

Thanks!

Edit: Money isn’t really a concern. I’m fine spending the $100, but I’m sure it could be put to better use."

I overcame my block and wrote a short film script. And yesterday, the script won the best script in a London film festival! My first award ever! And the film is in the pre-production now.

If it wasn't for my post and your kind responses and support, I would have very likely given up. Thank you so much. Keep writing! Keep creating! It is sometimes lonely and silent, but it is worthy.

Logline
When a music executive's magazine goes under he's forced to go back to work at his hip-hop label.

Strengths
The strongest aspect of this script are the characters. Each and every character in this script is well developed with their own individual wants, needs, goals, and point of view. Martell is an endearing and engaging protagonist who constantly pushes the story forward. The premise of the series is also clearly developed. The idea of following a struggling label using Napster as a scapegoat to its struggle and using that as a marketing ploy is a grounded and unique way into a serialized character drama in the music industry.

Weaknesses
The biggest issue with this project is the setting. Setting this series in the late 90s/early 2000s makes this project a hard sell simply because period pieces are expensive to produce. Using so many well known, real, artists such as Timbaland presents even more budgetary issues as the premise then may require the licensing of images in order to get made. The structure of the narrative is a bit all over the place and it's difficult to tell which story is supposed to be the A story. Martell's decision to sue Napster feels like it comes out of nowhere and is barely earned by his assistant's work spotting the SumSum leak. At 70 pages this script is very long and needs to cut unnecessary scenes. A drama script should land, ideally, between 55 and 65 pages maximum.

TV series potential:
This is a grounded and unique way in to a serialized music drama. Despite the potential high budget costs due to the period setting and the use of real images, this script should have no trouble garnering the attention of producers willing to develop it further and shepherd it to market.

Note: I have trimmed the script, but this is the script that the eval read

Title: Todd &amp; Horse

Logline

A jolly, storytelling outlaw cons his way into a sheriff’s deputy job and begins to question the allure of life on the lam.

Strengths

The script is well-written, and a lot of the dialogue jumps off the page. While the tone of the writing sometimes makes the concept and structural intent of the story hard to ascertain, the individual scenes flow well and offer many cinematic moments. Todd’s storytelling, his duel with the soldier, and battle with the birds in the desert, were memorable and vivid, even if they didn’t always come together as a coherent whole. It’s clear the author has an ear for comedic dialogue, and they might want to try their hand at a more marketable and contemporary comedy premise. Similarly, the fairly sparse description was compelling and engaging to read, and there were some really great story turns that were told in minimalistic but effective style (i.e. ‘The soldier falls face first in the mud. Everyone is disgusted, even Todd.’). In short, this script reads like the work of a talented writer even if the tone makes the emotions difficult to land and the premise feels like a hard sell.

Weaknesses

The tongue-in-cheek tone, which mashes up extreme violence and cartoonish interactions, makes it difficult to tell which emotional moments should be taken seriously and which shouldn’t. Elements such as tongues being ripped out feel extremely over the top, and yet the story isn’t a gonzo action comedy or a torture-porn horror film - in short, it’s a bit hard to tell where in the marketplace this material is intended to land, and the script struggles to create genuine emotion or imbue its characters with relatable and engaging dilemmas. As a protagonist, Todd is a cypher, and the loss of his gang members and the killing of horses only sort of affect him - it’s not really clear what his driving emotions or motivations are, and he seems more to be blowing in the wind than pursuing a clearcut goal. That makes sense if the world around him is providing the conflict and tension, but that isn’t the case either - Todd’s not an everyman caught in an extreme situation (a situation that is unique and essentially the concept of the film), and so the reason this character has been chosen as protagonist isn’t entirely clear. 

Prospects:

Conceptually, this sort-of-serious, sort-of-funny cowboy farce will have extreme difficulty in the contemporary marketplace. While there are many engaging moments, the main character lacks a clear goal that drives the narrative, while the world isn’t extreme or bananas enough to create a unique western premise. Nonetheless, the writing is good, even if a more consistent emotional journey is necessary. If the author can find a way to make Todd’s emotions and transformation feel like less of an extended joke as a whole, the script might be more impactful. Alternatively, if the humor were dialed up to define this material more clearly as a comedy, the script’s intent would be more clear."
Screenwriting,Hi do you know any grants or fundations that fund short films about women rights? Short description in post.,"This short film is about the veteran of Donbass war, who comes back home only to leave again in a few days. She wants to tell them truth about where she really was, but when she does, she faces even worse treatment than she ever expected.

Unfortunately inspired by a few true stories discovered during work with veterans on warious theater projects. It shows the state of things and prejudice women face when coming back from war in here.

Filming would be in Ukraine, so US-only funds wouldn't probably go for it. Anyone can suggest anything on internal scale.  Runtime gonna be about 24-30 minutes (current draft is about 28 pages long).

Any suggestions, folks?"

Screenwriting,A post-mortem on my failed first feature,"Hi everyone,

I recently had to pull the plug on a feature I had been working on for about a year. I was initially working on it on nights and weekends, then had taken a sabbatical from work back in early May to fully focus on pre-production, and was planning to start shooting on June 7th. However, I realized that I didn't have the logistical elements in place and hadn't spent enough time with the actors to make something I would have been proud of, so I decided to cancel the movie instead of going forward with it and subjecting the cast and crew to an unpleasant experience. 

After I decided to cancel the project, I put together a little post-mortem of the film -- what I wanted to accomplish, what I actually accomplished, what I learned, what I'd do differently, etc. I thought it may be helpful for this community to take a look at, and I also wanted to have the opportunity to speak with like-minded individuals about my experiences/anything similar you all may have gone through. 

The post-mortem is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZqZws--bGCSfGs-IsLBlRMNK596-FyLNad-JJqhHWrI/edit?usp=sharing

Screenwriting,playwrights looking to write for the screen,"Have you guys run across any good resources for playwrights looking to write for the screen?  I've had some success as a playwright, winning some playwriting contests and having my work performed onstage.   

There's a lot of overlap in the different writing forms.  Creating contrasting characters, creating a suspenseful plot, creating motives complicated by character flaws – all that stuff works well onstage, in novel writing, and on film, if done well.  However, there are big differences between the stage and the silver screen.  Stage plays are designed to have actors perform an entire script in the course of 120 minutes, or however long the play is, and they're generally limited in scene changes.  You can't constantly move props in and out in lengthy scene changes or you'll lose the audience.  Film is super visually oriented.  If you need a close-up shot of a butterfly for any reason, you can do that.  You could do an underwater fight scene between SCUBA divers if you needed to.  You can very quickly cut between short scenes (IF that works in the story).   

I have an idea of the differences, but I would love to read up on resources by writers who have successfully written for both formats.  I am aware that about the worst thing you could do would be to simply take a play script and film it.  Obviously, you've got to do many things very differently depending on the medium used.

Screenwriting,I want to talk to a screenwriter about the modern situations in Hollywood,I have a podcast which I will not post here for purposes of violating the rules. I'm looking for screenwriters and other such personnel who want to talk about Hollywood on a podcast. Yes it's a history podcast. But right now I'm doing oral histories. People have said I should talk to Shane Black or I should talk to Steven Spielberg or whoever. But I don't want to talk to those people because that misses the point.

Logline

Milton switches bodies with Conroy in order to woo his co-worker Renee, but can only keep Conroy's body for two days before having to switch back or pay up for even more time.

Strengths

The tone, the world, the dialogue, these characters are the stellar elements here. On concept and title, one might have no idea what this movie's going to feel like (silly? broad?). But the writing here is so compelling on the page that it carries this idea. Down to the use of metal bowls as high tech, the writing immerses in a world that screams for a director with Coen-esque or Anderson-esque style and humor. It's a pleasure to read characters who continually make unexpected to choices and dialogue that engages in that kind of Arrested Development-like wordplay. It's become a bit overdone in the TV world, but in features it's more rare and it's harder to carry off a full feature with a ton like this. But we actually do care about these characters, despite a sort of veneer of coldness and sarcasm, and we believe that they believe in what they want. The script also subverts a lot of body-switching ideas and plays with expectations (Milton being high upon entering Conroy's body, Milton gaining weight because, of course, he changed his body not his habits). This script manages to be not only a great advertisement for this writer's sensibility, but a credible play on a well-worn Hollywood film idea.

Weaknesses

The momentum just has to keep up, and right now the second half of the second act slows down quite a bit. The script starts to become more and more of an ensemble piece, and instead of feeling like a clear plotline that's motivated by strong action on the part of a protagonist, it kind of meanders its way to a conclusion through various (though sometimes very funny) near-tangential means (the reporter nearly hanging herself, the couples therapy session). The last scene is also, again, funny and clever, but feels like it's wrapping up a plot element we haven't really been looking for closure on. Renee is set up as a main character, but she becomes so reactive to Milton in the second half of the second act that she's not pushing forward story anymore. Her decision to let Conroy stay is a great one, but also feels a little generically-motivated (she's just afraid of dying alone?). Is there some specific reason why their relationship actually is perfect and works? The plot has the most momentum when it's about Mirch and Conroy's rivalry, their game of cat-and-mouse. It's almost too easy that Mirch and Renee can plant at a house and stay there, undetected, for so long.

Prospects:

This is a really unique piece of writing. It lives in the indie space, but that means so many things these days, and it could be made at quite a few budget ranges. The most important step here feels like it'll be grabbing a great director that can deliver on the tone of the writing while not making it feel cheesy or broad. That might be this writer, in which case they should and could just go out and try to make this, or make a proof-of-concept, etc. This script feels nearly ready for commercial consideration by agents, financiers, etc. So if they come back with a drat that really keeps up that momentum in the second half, one could see this making its way through Hollywood readers, maybe agencies. For there it could maybe grab the attention of an interesting, higher-level director who could get this movie made at a totally different price point. There are multiple paths, as always, but this writer should be confident in where they're at and try to crank out a draft that surprises, escalates, and delivers in the second half before taking those next steps.

Screenwriting,Anyone could share some tips for ESL on writing for screen?,"I’m an esl and I’m hoping to be a screenwriter in North America. Currently, I have great stories but I always find myself struggle in writing dialogues. Native speakers often talk with plenty of slangs and it’s hard for me to talk and think in the same way.

For example, people barely say “I’m angry” in a causal conversation. Instead, “I’m pissed” would be a more realistic approach to that expression. There are many other likewise situations where my dialogues sound quite off, even though the readers can understand what I was trying to express.

Also, I live and learned my English in Canada. I noticed that there are many different expressions(slangs) in the states (even within the states, it varies geographically). If I were to set my story somewhere in the states then I would want to have my characters be realistic and talk like Americans (even a bigger difference if I want to write a story that sets in the uk lol). Also, different professions might have their own slangs and terms to describe an action or objects (e.g. lawyers or doctors).

I’m trying to find a way to write better dialogues so that I can be a better screenwriter. It would be of great help if you can shed some lights in how to do research and learn to write dialogues like a native speaker as an esl."

For some context - like why am I interested in filmmaking? For the past year or so I have been watching really great masterpieces like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, etc. and I love them. I had already been interested in making movies, and that just kind of inspired me, in a way.

I was already at a point where I was doing well in school, I’m great at writing, and so I thought I’d give this a shot. I’m having so much fun. 

Being 14, I obviously have no way to actually make a movie or the money to use official screenwriting software, so I’m just writing my screenplay on google docs. It requires a bit of formatting, but it’s still fun. 

I’m making a western about this gang that takes over a town, there’s this bounty hunter/saloon owner that wants to collect on their bounties and a sheriff’s son that wants to kill them for personal reasons. So far it’s going well. 

If you guys have any constructive advice or any encouraging things to say I would appreciate that. Any sort of advice on, say, where’s a good college to go to, or how I might start a career in the future would also be helpful.

Screenwriting,Is it ok that the lesson protagonist teaches to supportive characters is sorta the same?,"You know how characters are meant to change by interacting with one another, they teach each other lessons, etc. Is it ok that the protagonist teaches a lesson that is at its core the same, but it has a different effect on lives of the supportive characters and it is expressed differently?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for weighing in.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: So the ""lesson"", or the way protagonist changes characters she comes across, can be summarized as : being more direct, standing up for yourself, confidence, going and getting what you want.

The way this affects Supp. Character 1, is that he stands up to his superior in a job, which leads to the main boss (antagonist) noticing that Supp. Character 1 is indeed right, which leads to a promotion.

They way this affects Supp. Character 2, is that she behaves with confidence and feels more comfortable in her own body, she goes for what she wants, which leads to acquiring the romantic goal she wanted."
Screenwriting,"Writing exercise, voice over narration, 5 pages","Hi Everyone, 

I haven’t written anything at all since December, and now I’m just starting to get back into the saddle.

I thought I’d dust-off the brain cells by writing an idea that may or may not turn out to be the teaser opening to the dystopian futuristic sci-fi pilot I was last working on. (The scene is effectively an adaptation of The Oatmeal’s piece “It’s going to be okay” about Gene Roddenberry and PanAm Flight 121.)

It’s also an exercise on writing voice-over narration of an action scene, which I’ve never written before. 

How did I do?

I feel like it’s a bit clunky, I’m not sure where to put voice-over dialogue in regarding to action. 
There are also a couple moments when the dialogue narrates the action. I can’t tell if it’s redundant but still necessary?

Also, usually when introducing characters, their age is includes, ie: DAD (male, 30s). Do you do this in VO as well? I couldn’t find a solid answer on that one.

Thanks!

Screenwriting,story line plotting software,"I want to use a system of note cards to map out the plot of screen plays and stage plays that I write.  If I wanted I could go old school and buy a big cork board from the home improvement store and then use 3” x 5” cards.  That would work.  In fact, that's how the Breaking Bad writers did it.  I saw it in a video on Youtube.  So that would work, but doing the same thing with software would have the advantage of I could do it on my laptop anywhere and not have to be at home with my cork board.   

My screenwriting software of choice is Fade In, and it does have an index card feature, but I've found something else that seems to do more.  The Writer's Café has multiple features besides index card plotting, and its index card system is more extensive.  You can put multiple plot lines up and see them next to on another.  That makes it easy to see if one plot line works well and if it's woven together with the other ones well or if it needs to be reworked.   

At first, I was finding the Writer's Café storylines feature difficult to use, but it's getting easier after reading its documentation and testing it out.  For now I'm just putting in stories that I don't intend to write, including just some stuff made up off the cuff and some Grimm's fairly tales.  The idea is to be good at using this thing before attempting to use it on an actual project.   

I'm curious if anyone here has used the Writer's Café storylines feature to plot out a screenplay (or other type of story).  It seems to fit the bill, but I haven't paid for it yet.  Registering the demo version will run me $45.  So I have the decision to make – whether to invest money and energy learning this thing or whether to just go with Fade In's built-in index cards feature.  Then there's the option of just buying a big cork board and pinning cards to it.   

If anyone else here has used Writer's Café or another similar program for plotting a story, I would be glad to hear from you.  WC also has some other features such as a random name generator and a scenario writing prompt, but the storylines feature is the one I would use it for."

**Logline:** ***A naive young boy believes himself responsible for the deadly snowstorm that killed his father and must hide the evidence from his mother before the police catch up to him.***

A few concerns I have about it that I would really appreciate outside opinion on:

I really hate throwaway characters and sometimes I read this and feel that Perez leaves too early, or doesn't feel important enough. But also, I think the ending needs to just be between Athena and Mack. Any thoughts on this?

Do the characters feel distinct enough? I spend a decent chunk of time during the outlining process developing the characters using the 'bone structure' method (Lajos Egri) and I find it very helpful going into a new story. However, I also feel like a lot of the time I have no idea how much of that legwork actually comes through, especially in something this short. Thoughts?

This one is more semantics, but I'm currently looking for specific segments of shows mentioned on the TV screen in the script (specifically for COPS) that would play out in front of Mackenzie early on and influence the way he conducts himself when he is paranoid around the police officer. If I found something specific, how would I go about writing that into the screenplay?

It’s been 5 weeks since I’ve sent the new draft and I’m going a little crazy here!

At this point I’m just looking for the peace of mind that signing the papers will give me. Being stuck in this ‘limbo’ of having my script verbally optioned but without having anything in writing is torture.

Screenwriting,"Thoughts on ""Vertical Writing""?","Came across this term in a YouTube comment, and started digging into it. I've read a lot about having plenty of whitespace, but I guess I never had a term for it.

I heard of one potential pro, and know if one big con:

The potential pro that people tout is that breaking up action lines kinda forces directors to not ignore certain actions, without you having to direct on the page. Any truth to this? I'm a control freak, so any way I can try to avoid losing an iota of control would be nice lol.

The big con is page count. More white space means longer scenes (page count-wise), which can make you have to cut valuable stuff in order to stay between 90-120 pages or so. In my own screenplay, I've realized that it would add about 4-5 pages to my script just by itself!"

The original project dates back to this past September. I spent the whole month developing plot points, characters, and themes. Yet when it was time to write, I completely froze. I had classes and an internship as well, but I know deep down that juggling them wasn't the issue. 

The cool thing about revisiting it now is that all of that work paid off: I knew the characters and their situations like the back of my hand, and I knew which plot points to focus on and which to either place in the background or toss aside altogether. 

Since that day, I've tried keeping the momentum going. For one thing, I recognized that I'm 100% a morning person: it's easier for me to wake up early and write as opposed to telling myself ""You've got to write today"" and pushing it off all day before I'm too tired to work. 

Hemingway is a big inspiration for me and I started following his bit of advice: 

*“The most important thing I’ve learned about writing is* ***never write too much at a time****. Never pump yourself dry. Leave a little for the next day. The main thing is to know when to stop. Don’t wait till you’ve written yourself out. When you’re still going good and you come to an interesting place and you know what’s going to happen next, that’s the time to stop. Then leave it alone and don’t think about it; let your subconscious mind do the work. The next morning, when you’ve had a good sleep and you’re feeling fresh, rewrite what you wrote the day before. When you come to the interesting place and you know what is going to happen next, go on from there and stop at another high point of interest.* 

It's been working fairly well for me so far. I do this thing in my notes where I write ""Coming up next..."" before listing a few scenes I'd like to work on the next day, maybe adding a few bullet points about what to include so I have a quick refresher. This also works for me because I can write it out of order. I think attempting to write it from beginning to end last time was what inadvertently straightjacketed my work. 

So my question to you r/screenwriting is **What do you do to keep the momentum going? To find the energy to keep working on a project instead of procrastinating/staring nervously back at the sea of blank whiteness?**"
Screenwriting,"Writers who are writing with a full time job and other responsibilities, what's your routine like?","I got myself a job today. Gonna be grinding alot. Gonna have to squeeze in time for my Writing. 

Was just curious to know how you all manage with your jobs and other responsibilities."
Screenwriting,"[Movie Suggestions] Movies like ""Whiplash"": protagonist sacrifices everything to achieve their dream / obsession for success / relentless ambition.","""Black Swan"" is a bit different in my opinion though it shares the theme of the pursuit for perfection.

""La La Land"" is also of the same theme, but with much lighter tone.

""Burnt"" (with Bradley Cooper) sends sort of the opposite message.

Anything else? 

I saw a similar/old post on MovieSuggestions sub, but I'm also interested in screenwriting sub's suggestions.

Screenwriting,Is being a TV writer all it’s cracked up to be?,"I’ve been writing for a while for my local theater scene and I’m wanting to get serious about trying to write for TV.  However I’m stopping to ask a question I don’t think many people do stop to ask themselves.  Is this worth it?  Will I be happy as a TV writer when it is my job to write for a living, particularly in someone else’s voice?

My guess is most will say pursue this only if you can’t see yourself doing anything else.   Mainly because it’s incredibly difficult and requires hard work.  I love to create and write, and doing so locally, whether through theater or video may be enough for me.  That said there is that part of me that romanticizes the idea of writing for TV.  Looking for a sobering view of this fantasy."

Screenwriting,What books and films will be good references for writing dialogues for characters based in 1940s Southern England?,"Hey everyone!
I'm a writer from India. The spec I'm working on right now is based in 1940's colonial India and a small town in Southern England around the same time. 
While writing for the characters who live in England, I feel like I'm not able to give their roots enough justice. It ends up sounding like modern English with a London accent.
Can anyone suggest me any books written during those years? I would also like to watch some historically accurate films and tv shows based in that time period, but I'm not sure where to start.

So, I've done a fair amount of looking around google and what-not, in search of the answer to this question...

What do you do after you finish your pilot script? I've edit and revised it, but I really want to continue writing the story. My only issue, is I'm not sure if that is what you do or not. I've read that you can pass the script over to trusted individuals, such as family and friends, for feedback, or submit it to contests.   
But tha'ts all I can find.  


Can you continue writing your script? A couple episodes in? Do you continue editing and revising until its at it's best version? What do you do? I'd really love to know.

Screenwriting,Drama/light hearted script &lt; Oscar?,"Can a light hearted drama script ever win an Oscar?

Knives Out or Emma felt very upbeat but those have the sense of comedy with the mystery or drama. What technically in writing a script will never get an Oscar? Can something like a drama/mystery about a relationship ever work critically?"
Screenwriting,Is it alright to have a very similar situation in two different scripts?,"So my first script is between present day and flashbacks. It's about a dad taking care of his alienated son after his mom went to India to take care of her dying father (present day). The flashbacks establish the relationship between the son and grandfather(mom's dying dad) and how much they mean to each other. By the end of the script the grandpa dies. And the closed off dad has to learn how to be there for his son.

My second script is a bit different. It takes place in three acts like boyhood/moonlight. Three different stages of life. The first act is about the Grandpa coming from india to America and how the main character (a young boy) develops a strong bond with him and then at the end of the first act the grandpa dies.

In my real life my grandpa passing away was the first time I've ever lost a family member and that relationship meant a lot to me. But I was wondering if it's redundant to have the same life event happen in two different projects."

So I posted a few weeks ago looking for feedback for a different part of this screenplay, and I loved your feedback so much I decided to ask again for the beginning that I finally got to. I haven't really been writing much so I have not yet changed the first feedback part of the screenplay, but it is on a lower page so just ignore that haha. Just a heads up this is my very first screenplay so please let me know if you think I should add more action lines in the dialogue part. Also I'm very good at picturing things in my head but not so great at putting it into words, so I'm sorry if the very beginning is a little confusing.

Screenwriting,Taking a brief break from a story to help with writer's block???," So I'm writing a script and I have been stuck in the outlining phase for a month now. I finished the first draft around the beginning of May, but I was unhappy with it, so I decided to rewrite it. I have a new outline written out, but it's a bit too long for a screenplay. In addition to that, there are still a few continuity problems that I am having trouble ironing out.

Honestly, I'm feeling rather drained with this story and I can't seem to get out of this block. I'm a pretty stubborn person and I want to see this project through, but I feel so frustrated/stressed with having to rewrite this story/constantly getting stuck with the outline (which makes it harder for me to think of new ideas).

Does anyone think it's a good idea to take a break from a project that they're stuck on, and maybe start writing on something else in the meantime before coming back to the original project?

What do you guys do when you're feeling stuck/having trouble planning out your story?

I'm a relatively new writer and have written a longer script (90-120 pages) and two shorter scripts (15-30 pages). While I have experienced writer's block with those stories, I feel like I was able to get over those hurdles in a shorter amount of time. With this story, I just feel like it's a mess and I can't really make progress on it.  
Is there a point where it's better to call it quits on a certain story?"

Lets say I sell a script that then gets made into a movie. If I then want to use the characters from that script/movie in another one of my works, say a book or another movie, can I legally do so as the original creator of those characters?

Screenwriting,How do I make people care about a character they don't outright see?,"So I've got a bunch of ideas stirring in my head right now, one of which involves a protagonist whose goal is to save/retrieve his friend who's effectively been ""captured"". Much of the story will involve the protagonist pursuing his friend until he finally meets up with him, and through a strange twist of fate they end up fighting each other, as his friend has effectively been brainwashed into doing so. I'm planning on keeping this friend from being seen very often, if at all, and I'm just wondering how I could go about making the eventual interactions between the two be meaningful and something people would care about. The protagonist would make new friends on his journey to save his old friend, and I suppose he could reflect on the time they spent together to his new friends, but I'm sure there's more I could do than that. Just curious if anyone has any advice on this type of story."
Screenwriting,Just for Fun - How would you write a reboot to the 1979 film: The Black Hole?,"My Pitch:

Set it in the year 2979

Get Neil DeGrasse Tyson fully on board.

Then base your story on that.

Loosely follow some stuff from the original. pay homage where you can

But surprise the audience with a unique killer story, that is not too dark and not too shlock kid robot stuff.

Hope you're doing well.
I have a question. Do you think too much in the budget when you start a script? If you have an idea for, let's say a fantasy story, Do you discard that idea if you picture that the project will need a lot of money? Or do you just do it and then see if someone is interested?

60 hour work weeks, two free days on weekends, and I push off sleeping as far as I can.

I'm never not thinking about writing, it's become a bad addiction at this point. The only catch is when I'm reading, I feel as if I'm wasting time that I could be using to write. And when I write, I feel like I'm skipping half of the learning process. It's a poor tug of war battle.

To my question, how do you schedule your screenwriting life? Has it worked for you? Do you have any advice for me? And do you think there's an optimal way to learn the craft?"

Screenwriting,Avoiding seemingly unavoidable distractions pre-climax,"I'm working on an end-of-the-world rom-com (or dram-com) and I continually run into the same issue no matter how I reorganize the plot. I want the main character to end up spending the end of the last day with their love interest/SO/the other main character, but I always end up having to navigate family relations immediately before this scene. If I keep the main character where they are, they end up leaving their single mother alone for the last day (which would make the audience like the protagonist less and distract from the actual meaning of the movie). If I have them live somewhere different, I have to find a way to have them not give in and move back to their hometown to spend it with their family (same effect).

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like no matter how I organize things, family always ends up distracting from what I want to be the actual climax and overall meaning of the script. Having the family be dead or estranged from the main character both feel like cop outs, but at this point I genuinely can't figure out a way to navigate this.

Screenwriting,What do you watch while you’re writing?,"My imagination gets so easily affected by movies that I love. I start visualizing my script in the same style of the movie I just watched - it’s even worse if it’s a genre/auteur director/film.

I love Fincher, but while I’m writing and in the zone, I have to stay so far away from him because then all my ideas are shrouded in his style to the point where I can’t think straight. 

So this has me wondering, what do you watch or don’t watch? Do you stay in your genre, or out? 
Is what you watch on your down time dictated by what you’re currently working on? If you weren’t working on anything would your viewing playlist be different than if you were writing? I heard even some actors while shooting will watch reality TV or documentaries to separate themselves from the cinematic POV.

EDIT: I should have clarified, I don’t mean strictly while sitting at your computer writing, instead what do you watch on your spare time between writing session (on your break/down time before starting up again)"

What should be a really tense scene doesn't read well.

Anyone know of a trick to make it less obvious? The characters are teens in the high school scenes and late 30s in the other scenes, so I do need to differentiate them somehow. I've thought about using their last names for the other scenes but I don't know how that would work either.

Screenwriting,Do I even have a chance starting at 28?,"I am 27, nearly 28 and honestly I am feeling old. 

I have a lot of ideas for a script, but I am reluctant to put out the work because I think my age will hinder my chance, as I know that most screen writers start in the business young as assistant’s and I feel like I’ve wasted most of my time trying to find a “practical career.”

My partner doesn’t want to move to LA/NY, as many recommend, so I am also discouraged in this regard. I get where she is coming from and I don’t resent her for it, as we have a new family that we have to support.

Screenwriting,Killers of the Flower Moon script,Anyone have a draft?
Screenwriting,Reconsider that $1 option,"Story time. A producer got a hold of me wanting to know what I want to do next after my 1st feature came out. We chatted for a bit... Nice guy, has a few movies under his belt so I sent him a script.

He gets back to me and wouldn't you know it, he loves the script! He wants to option it and team up to try to make it. Great! He's no A lister and I get that so we settle on the good ole James Cameron a-la the first Terminator. Producer gets script for $1. I get to write and direct it... So far so good.

He draws up a contract, I send it to my lawyer, we go over what's fair and what to go back to the producer with. So I email producer requesting a few things be changed, a couple wordings... Nothing crazy.

I haven't heard from him since. Now I'm down almost $1000 in lawyer fees, they are not cheap.

Overall I just wanted to say, don't get caught up in the headspace of seeing stars because a producer is interested in you. Remember, they have nothing without us writers, that's why they're coming to us. They need us to write their movies, if they didn't, then they would be writing it.

As an old boss once told me about a shitty, shitty job I had \*cough\* Pepsi \*end cough\* ""they need you more than you need them"" and I feel this definitely applies here.

I should say, obviously some producers will be right for you and your script regardless of if they offer more than $1 for an option but use your gut and I might suggest saying 'hey, $1 is fine but you gotta cover my legal fees'. I feel like anyone that's really serious and can't wait to make your script would find that as very reasonable. If they aren't willing to put some skin in the game, why should you?

It was a shitty hit to the wallet but hey... I'm still glad I had the experience. I know more than I did before even if it was an expensive lesson but best of all, my script that I love isn't in the hands of a producer that won't be able to do anything for me and I've avoided a stressful year of dealing with someone I don't like who would just drag down my mood.

Personally I like a little bit of character description when reading a screenplay. I know sometimes it's excluded so there won't be limitations if the work is produced and when it comes to casting, but at the same time, I think a character's physical attributes can be relevant to the narrative, so it's OK to mention them briefly. 

Anyway. Interested in feedback on this. Thanks!"

Screenwriting,Excessive CAPS! How y'all feel about it.,"I may have a capitalization PROBLEM. 

Just as I did there. I've been using caps alot as part of my writing style. I usually use them to hopefully make it a better read and highlight important sounds, actions and details. I still also use them in their normal use (introducing new characters). 

I only cap ONE word at a time and use no more than TWO per action block, as such. 

So how do you guys feel about this, does it matter, not important, or very unprofessional. STOP IT NOW. 

It's not bad in my opinion but I know that's subjective."
Screenwriting,[FEEDBACK] Et Cetera (Camp Comedy/Noir) 160 pgs,"NOTE: I'm redoing this post cause I edited the script down by cleaning up the formatting some. 

So this is my first time I writing in standard script format. I've written before but I usually shoot my own projects so I normally write it how I want. I hope I got the format correctly. I used Celltx. It wouldnt let me add the title page I wrote to the actual script when I went to download the script. 

LOGLINE: Set in a cookie cutter community in the 1950's, three monsters: a vampire, a werewolf and an invisible woman, try to fit into suburbia. But when their billionaire boss crosses a line, they devise a plan to kill him only to find that he has a portrait that never let's him die. 

What I would like feedback on the most is the arc of the character of Uno. His story was the hardest one for me to crack cause he went from being mostly a side character to a lead. I tried to do this thing where you start the story thinking it's this campy crime thriller but then it switches halfway through to be this commentary on the intersectionality of race, sexuality and class. I don't know if I pulled it off. 
Also ACT 3 caused me the most grief because I've rewritten it about six times now and still don't know if it works. So I'd very much like feedback on that as well. 

I get that it's long. I cut it down as much as I could. If you think it's too long tell me what you think I could cut without basically changing the entire point of the story. What I'm going for here is basically what if you took those sitcoms from the 50's and 60's, and that whole perfect suburban archetype we see in those, and you peeled back some of the veneer. Why do we love nostalgia? Why do we love the 50s? Why are Americans so obsessed with going back to some imaginary golden era? I started writing this not long after the Charlottesville riots and basically it became my somewhat veiled response to the alt-right, Donald Trump, America's obsession with nostalgia and where I see this country going. I tried to mimic some of the histrionic and over the top dialogue from some of my favorite films like All About Eve, Imitation of Life, Mildred Pierce, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane and basically any movie Douglas Sirk ever made:

Logline: ""Twenty-seven years later, a local police chief struggles with the mysterious disappearance of a little girl. A stranger, two agents, and a teenager enter his town, setting off a dangerous domino effect, unraveling a dark secret that endangers the lives of everyone.""

Synopsis: An egotistical, sedated, schizophrenia teenager comes back to his hometown after being in rehab for nearly four years. When he finds out that his old group of friends has split up and the town's police chief is looking for a missing little girl, he hatches a plan. He brings his friends together to go off looking for the little girl but instead witness her murder by a dangerous cult.

Now his friends must protect him from not only his drugged induced self but a murderous cult and secret government agents.

As some of you will remember, I started a free script hosting platform called [Script Revolution](https://www.scriptrevolution.com/) back in 2016. Many of you were incredibly supportive back then and have remained so over the years.

I'm super-proud to say that the site had its **10,000** member join this week.

I'm a one man band who has to do everything myself and thus the community has relied on nothing more than word of mouth to grow. It's been tough and a very steep learning curve on top of trying to break-in as a screenwriter myself.

I've received a lot of feedback from you guys and I'm still trying to implement what I can. I can assure you that a lot more is being done to help [validate and curate the content](https://www.scriptrevolution.com/featured) to help highlight scripts and writers that have [wins](https://www.scriptrevolution.com/award-winning-scripts) &amp; [endorsements](https://www.scriptrevolution.com/professionally-endorsed-scripts), etc from third-parties so people can leverage their existing successes.

The [success stories](https://www.scriptrevolution.com/success-stories) are also coming in more frequently now. Are they huge deals? No. Most aren't even medium sized deals, to be frank, but they are the kind of deals that can kick-start a career.

There's also a bunch of partnerships that exist now between Script Revolution and ScriptHop, WriterDuet, What You Don't Learn In Filmschool, Indie Film Hustle, Think IP, Stage 32, Bulletproof Screenwriting, Script Studio, Simply Scripts, Prewrite, and ScriptReader Pro.

And yes, I'm talking to plenty of other platforms too, including those I may have shown some animosity toward in the past (proudly shows off I' m wearing my big-boy pants now).

There's still a long way to go but I'm so happy to still be in the game after nearly five years.

Obviously I'd have to explain the story and what it's about. I'm also planning on stating the characters and their traits. The film that I'll be making will be an artsy/abstract one, and one that will attempt to explore some philosophical questions while telling a story.

Screenwriting,Difficulty Understanding Character Motivation,"I've been studying filmmaking and screenwriting for almost a decade. I've written scripts and treatments over this time but I've found I've barely gotten better at writing characters. When trying to stay consistent to what I believed their motivations to be, I found the logical actions stemming from those motivations to seem incorrect and convoluted, especially toward the third acts. I've had an even harder time with this as I got older and more mature.

It wasn't until rewatching Breaking Bad recently that I noticed something that seemed indicative of my problem. Gus and Tuco are both motivated by the desire to make money from meth distribution, but their actions are extremely different, even in similar situations. Gus is so calculated while Tuco is compulsive. Tuco will even unnecessarily take actions that go against his own interest. This stood out to me because these characters would behave identically (more like Gus) if I were to write them because they both want the same thing.

I'm trying to figure out what's missing in my mental model of characterization that would allow for two characters in identical situations with identical motivations and identical resources (physical capabilities and knowledge) to do different things. Or maybe this mental model is correct and there's something else I'm doing wrong.

I am on the autism spectrum so my whole issue could be symptomatic of a aspect that I haven't found workaround for yet. Or it could just be something about screenwriting I haven't learned yet."

Screenwriting,Scriptwriting term for a single line exchange between 2 characters,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a script-writer, and I wanted to ask what the general term was for describing when 2 characters exchange a line each (i.e. comprises a couple of lines). I don't think ""exchange"" is the correct term, as it risks being misinterpreted as an entire conversation.

The below example contains 3 such exchanges between Tim and George:

&amp;#x200B;

* *Tim: Hey George,*
* *George: Yeah?*
* *Tim: What's the scriptwriting term for when 2 characters exchange a line of script?*
* *George: Isn't that a ""couplet""?*
* *Tim: No, I think that refers to poetry rather than screenplay.*
* *George: I'd double-check that if I were you. But otherwise, I do know.*

&amp;#x200B;

I guess a script writer would call each exchange an ""X"", and so would be able to say ""This scene contains 3 ""X"" between Tim and George"". I just would like to know what ""X"" would be.

Any assistance would be appreciated. Thanks."

Screenwriting,Feeling like I'm in a Shepard Tone,"So I'm a screenwriter early in my career, and I'm feeling a certain kind of frustration. Some time ago, I had a screenplay optioned. I got some money for that, and my producer is gearing up to pitch it to several parties this summer. Last year, during my country's first lockdown, I co-wrote a pretty cool action-horror-comedy with a director. He got some of his Canadian connections interested and that script has been optioned. That was a dollar option (or, euro option), but still, it was with an actual production company that has actual credits. Ever since I decided to fully focus my ambitions on screenwriting in 2015, every year has seen a significant improvement in my career over the year before.

Still, any form of steady income, let alone enough to quit my day job, is still just out of my reach. That could change before the end of the year. But also, it could not. It might never come. And while having had two screenplays optioned feels like something that for certain screenwriters means potential representation will find them, I live far outside the US, and even in my country's film industry, these moments of success have happened far outside of the mainstream.

Basically the frustration I'm dealing with is that my screenwriting feels like a [Shepard Tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone). Like it's always rising, yet never actually doing that. Don't get me wrong, I love writing, but I am serious about making a career out of it. And at this point, that point feels simultaneously both just around a corner, as well as a pipe dream.

I suppose I'm sharing this not just because I found the metaphor of the Shepard Tone so spot on, but also because I was wondering if other people either struggle with this, or have struggled with this in the past."
Screenwriting,Musing and Gazing at my Bellybutton,"I finished a first draft this afternoon (woot, yay, huzzah!) and I partook of my first draft tradition-- opening a cold root beer.

As I was sipping my tasty cold bev, I thought to myself: ""Wow, first drafts are bad,"" and then realized, ""but it's also the only time a script ever feels *done.*""

This blew my mind a little, but I think it's true.

First draft completions are, of course, the beginning of a long road of rewrites just to get it civilized and tame enough for management to look, and then the adventures of rounds and rounds and rounds of other people's notes until someone shoots a fluid draft and then takes it into the editing bay.

tldr: after you finish the first draft, the script improves but is never again finished.

So while the first draft opens the door to endless revisions... it's also the only time you can open a root beer and say: *Ah, it's done (ish).*

Does anyone else feel this way?"

Screenwriting,"Sacrifice, privilege, and moving to LA.","I respect that this is an industry built on reputation and relationships, but the more I think about it, the more I feel like this is a serious problem. The symptoms of which you can see in a distinct lack of diversity in stories, creators, actors, etc. I know I'm not the only person to feel this way, but [this recent post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/nmf33p/a_note_on_how_to_get_a_rep/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) made my discomfort click into place internally. (No offense to the advice - it's sound advice and I accept its truth)

I'm ambivalent about moving to LA. If I have to do it to really kick off my screenwriting career, than so be it. I'd probably try to compromise and live in New York first - fly out for meetings and whatnot - but uprooting my life in the UK for the US seems to be the price to pay for being in the 'right' place. I also have enough in savings that I could probably take a massive pay cut, work a low-paying industry gig just to get my foot in the door. 

But what I just described is so wrought with privilege I balk at the injustice of it. There are tens of thousands of better writers than me that will never have the means to just uproot to another country, live off savings, and get that chance of success. And with the way the pandemic has shaken up the way we work and meet, isn't now the perfect time to actively make changes to these barriers-to-entry? Just because it's always been done ""this"" way, doesn't make it the ""only"" way. 

I kinda just wanted to vent my frustration and heartbreak at this realization, and see how others feel."

This would continue for each of the six main characters, and then repeated as time progresses, similar to Arrested Development Season 4, before all being featured together in one “episode” at the end.

Screenwriting,Five minute script for TV?,"I'm doing this as a class requirement for my class in uni and I'm having a hard time conceptualizing a script that can fit start-to-finish in just five minutes. I can easily write when given a plot, I just can't make one myself?

I used to writing thirty minute short films/full length novels and I'm getting a bit frustrated about my writing because five minutes is too short for me to flesh out a decent script. It just feels like I'm writing a single scene in a single episode or something.

Screenwriting,"Made an entire script in three weeks, sent it into black list and got a 7","Edit: Also I sent this script into reddit along with my logline and several other things. You guys tore my script apart and it helped me revise it into what it is right now. So I also would just like to say thanks for actually helping. Your feedback truly meant a lot.

Edit 2: Hey, I figured it’d be nice to update, but my next review was a 6. It seems that many people have had complaints about the material being very short. He wanted to explore more of the comedy club, which is fine. He also labeled it as a comedy/dramatic comedy. If you want to check out the review, go ahead and search my script on Blcklst.

Title: Terribly Good With Words

For information, I have only been truly script writing for one year and writing in proper format for about six months. So in other words, I am by no means a pro. The script I wrote is heavily based on my interactions with my dad and several of my sibling and romantic relationships. If there's anything else you want to know, feel free to ask, but I am only showing this because I'm extremely ecstatic at the moment even though this is only one step. Here's the review:

## Overall Rating: 7/10

## Premise: 6/10

## Plot: 8/10

## Character: 8/10

## Dialogue: 8/10

## Setting: 7/10

Era: Present

Locations: Church, apartment, house, comedy club, wedding reception

Budgets: Medium

Genre: Comedy, Dark Comedy, Drama, Family Drama

Logline: Matthew's life spirals out of control as he struggles to accept the death of his father, and he starts to alienate his close friends and family.

Strengths

The structure is really, really good. Matthew hits his lowest point at the perfect time. I liked how Pete was incorporated into the script, that worked really well. That storyline is really strong. The characters are great. Matt feels like a real person and talks like a real person. Tamika, Pete and Melissa all feel like real people too. Tamika and Matt's relationship is great throughout the script, and it makes sense that her cutting him off sends him over the edge. The details thrown in about Pete liking certain TV shows and stuff like that make the characters even stronger. All of the dialogue was natural and fit each character's personality. Overall, it's really good. I'd be happy to watch this movie.

Weaknesses

I'd really like to see Matt's comedy routines on the page. That last one is really important to the story, and the audience should see the payoff from everything we've seen Matt through. Melissa is a good character, but putting in more specific details about her and showing more of the good side of her and Matt's relationship would make her and that storyline stronger. I think adding some more information about Matt's connection with his father over comedy before the final flashback would strengthen the whole film. It gives the audience a look at how meaningful comedy is to Matt and why he's having so much trouble with his father's death. While we see some of the abuse that Matt dealt with growing up, a little bit more detail and information about it would also strengthen everything. It would give even more weight and complex emotion to the story arc.

Prospects:

I think this has good prospects, especially if some major names in comedy were to get involved. There have been a few of films and shows similar to this with a standup comedian as the central character, but most have a prominent comedian playing the lead role. I'm sure there are plenty of comedians willing to take part in this type of project, and many who would help produce it as well. Dark comedy is a lucrative genre right now as well. I don't see why this project wouldn't have plenty of interested producers."
Screenwriting,What's an ideal writing schedule?,"Hey all, 

I'm here today because I want to know your thoughts about what a writer's ideal schedule should look like. I have a background of making music and to develop my craft I'll do 3 things:

1. I'll create songs. (60% of my time)

2. I'll work on improving a skill or an area I'm lacking in. (30% of my time)

&amp; 3. I'll listen to music. (10%)

Now I'm going to go ahead and assume that philosophy would translate well to screenwriting and my activities for music would be replaced by 1. Writing, 2. Developing a writing skill, and 3. Reading screenplays/watching movies, but I want your opinion about an ideal practice schedule, and roughly how much time 1, 2 and 3 would take up?

Interested in reading your replies and I hope this can spark some interest into this topic for some of you!

Edit: I also want to ask if this ratio would differ for a beginner (who maybe needs to develop specific skills and read screenplays before starting the writing process), vs a pro (who would mostly be writing)."

Screenwriting,Top 10 Screenwriters That Deserve A Biopic,"“With David Fincher’s latest critical darling [*Mank*](https://screenrant.com/tag/mank/) gaining more mainstream awareness after receiving several Academy Award nominations,[ including Best Picture](https://screenrant.com/oscars-2021-nominations-best-picture-movies-ranked/), it only makes sense to look through the dense and fascinating history of the craft of screenwriting to shine a light on other screenwriters who are deserving of having their story told on the big screen.

The innovative manner in which *Mank* interweaved with *Citizen Kane* once again proved the massive [potential of the cinematic medium to bring the world of the film writer to life](https://screenrant.com/best-biopics-2020-imdb-ranked/) in fresh and interesting ways. That being said, here are the ten screenwriters we think are most primed for their own biopic.”

Omitted from this list is Rod Serling. Serling’s life would be perfect for a biopic. I'm not just saying this because I'm a HUGE fan of The Twilight Zone. There's a great story to be told. After leaving high school, he enlisted in the army during WWII. He was sent to the Philippines which disappointed him since he wanted to fight against Hitler.

While in the Philippines, Serling saw a lot of death both at the hands of the Japanese and his allies. Serling struggled as a field soldier according to Sergeant Frank Lewis. Serling lacked the wits and aggressiveness for combat.

Serling’s experience at war left him deeply scarred and it influenced a lot of his writing particularly on The Twilight Zone. A biopic on Serling would mirror something close to a war drama, which is something these other writers, as great as they are, can’t give.

Let me know if there's any screenwriters that you think should get a biopic.

Screenwriting,Note on Querying reps - please do not call!,"Hi everyone! I am a literary manager here in LA and I just wanted to politely give some totally unsolicited advice to the group, specifically those of you who are unrepped and querying people. 

Do. Not. Call. 

Please. 

We are all working from home right now which has been a challenge for everyone. I am truly blessed that I get to continue to work on behalf of my clients and have had a steady job during a time when so many have lost their jobs. 

However it has been a challenge to continue to communicate with execs when you are trading calls from assistant to assistant on their cells, and you are returning calls on your cell. I kept missing calls from people I NEEDED to connect with who were calling my office, so In my voicemail I included my cell phone so people who needed me could get me right away. 

Again I do not mean this to be rude, but I cannot fully express how much of a turn off it is to get someone calling me on my personal cell pitching me their script. To give you a little perspective, my phone rings when someone calls my office. If I am on a call with someone, I will probably ignore. But when that same number calls my cell, now I think it’s time sensitive or an emergency (someone calling me back or someone who needs to get a hold of me). It is frustrating to then answer a call and hear someone winding up into a long pitch. It is very very frustrating to get these calls at 9am, 10am in the morning. Which happened many times. 

If you are going to call, please do not pitch anything. Please just ask for an email address to direct your query and I will happily give it (“hi my name is so-and-so and I would love to share my newest script with you. Do you accept queries and is there an email I can direct it to?”).

I understand you want to be read. I read all my query letters. I want to read your query. I want to read new writers and find great new voices. But I really really really do not want to speak on the phone, especially on my personal cell. 

Thank you so much for understanding. I really hope this doesn’t come off as entitled or rude, I am just trying to be honest and give my personal perspective. Happy writing and wishing you all the best. I am happy to answer any questions anyone may have in regards to query letters, representation, or anything else."
Screenwriting,The State of Things,"So, I have my usual little group of execs and producers that I'm on friendly terms with -- they're happy to look at anything new if it piques their interest, like they've always been.

However, I have been noticing lately that reaching out to agencies and managers, as well as more 'broad' submissions to prod companies/producers I'm not very familiar with, aren't stirring up the same amount of interest that they used to. 

Previously, people were generally happy to read something if the pitch interested them, but right now, there's a lot more 'sorry, we can't take on any new projects right now' and 'I'm just too swamped with my current client load' than usual. 

I was curious if other people are running into this right now?"
Screenwriting,What are your favorite concepts from any genre that you feel is extremely unseen or underutilized?,"I'm looking to write a script, and am having trouble finding an idea.

Currently I'm toying with a gangster script where two members of a family unknowingly drive through the night with a tied-up man in the trunk, who happens to be a wolfman. It's fun, but I want to put it away for a bit and try my hand at another story. Any ideas would help and hopefully this can help other writers on here!"

Screenwriting,Question about originality/tropes,"I was looking over Erik Bork's book *The Idea* and comparing my treatment up against his ""seven elements for a viable story."" I keep getting stuck on the O (original) element. I want to give my story a fresh premise and approach, but also don't want to try to reinvent the wheel or force some weird twist just for the sake of originality. I look at an awesome movie like John Wick which has such a simple premise of ""ex-hitman gets revenge by shooting everyone who has wronged him or stands in his way,"" and nothing stands out as new or fresh in the screenplay. Yet it works and everything comes together on screen in a way that makes it feel very fresh. 

My story is fairly similar in that it's not exactly ""high-concept,"" but instead is a fairly straightforward war thriller. Should I even be worrying about that before I actually start writing pages? My plan right now is to just write it and try to avoid standard tropes like Deus ex Machina and ""Don't you die on me!"" type stuff."

Screenwriting,A note on how to get a rep,"I see a lot of posts on here where young writers ask how to get a rep. I thought I'd put in my two cents.

I've had a few reps over my career and all of my writer friends are repped. I thought I'd give a rough rundown of how we've all gotten our managers / agents:

75% - someone we knew was repped, we wrote something good or had a project that had some heat, and we passed that script along to our friend's manager and they signed us - or pointed us in the direction of a rep who might be interested in signing us

OR: we worked at a production company and got to know the reps personally. Same vibes as above.

I know successful people who would not be successful if they didn't know someone who introduced them to someone else...

15% - a project had some heat - usually something we self-produced or worked with indie producers to develop - and there was enough heat that reps reached out to us

10% - contests / diversity programs - self explanatory. Gonna put the added note that it's a lot easier to get into those programs if you have made contact with the people running them, or you know someone who has gone through them.

My overall point here is:

1. for the best chance to get repped, you need to be out in LA networking / meeting people, etc. Take UCLA extension classes, join or create writers groups, go to meet ups and try to get to know people further along in their career than you...
2. you need to write something that is good enough for people to *want* to rep you. Almost none of the people I know got repped off their first script, second script, etc. We're talking like script #5 at least. So if you're fretting about making that first script perfect so you'll win Script Pipeline, you're fretting about the wrong thing. Or if you're feeling bad because your blacklist coverage gave your script a 5, don't sweat it. It's a learning process and you get better as you go.

EDIT: I forgot, I do know *one* writer who got a rep through query letters. That's not to say you're wasting your time doing it, but it gives you a little perspective on an overall strategy."
Screenwriting,Out-of-the Box Outline Technique - thoughts?,"This comes from Pilar Alessandra at On The Page. I like outlining, but this is a new perspective. It gives the structure you need but allows for discovery, too. What say you?

_I hate outlining. I know this is a weird thing to say because I’m a writing teacher. But truthfully, I find the act of figuring out every beat in advance and synopsizing every scene to be a bit joyless. Where does invention and discovery come in? What about those wonderful in-the-moment story breakthroughs?_

_At the same time, organization and story focus keeps you from writing yourself into a corner later on._

_So how do you find the balance?_

_1. Only outline the act breaks.
Honestly, if you just know where your act is going to land, you can write toward that act break and probably be just fine. For feature films, think about the end of Act 1, the midpoint of the movie, the end of Act 2 and the final sequence. For TV think of an act break roughly every ten minutes (teaser and five acts for one-hour and three acts for half-hour single camera.) What’s the big event that turns the story at these key points? That’s your act break._

_2. Brainstorm the main events.
Once you’ve got your act breaks figured out, just jot down the central events that will help get you there. Do you need to establish a character’s goal? Is this the act where your character makes a big attempt at something? Does a major obstacle need to be overcome? Write it down._

_3. Stop outlining. Start writing.
I mean it. Once these key points are determined, hit the page. Your characters might surprise you as they speak and act. A subplot may emerge. A payoff might come out of an unexpected set-up. Give yourself room to create!_

_There really is merit in developing a story as you write. You don’t have to outline all of the scenes. Promise._"

Title: FROM THE INSIDE

synopsis:

In a mental ward, patients are treated for different reasons. They are expected to be kept safe and well looked after during their stay until one day; a set of killer twins, a war veteran and a man who claims to see fictional characters begins their life within the hospital dubbed as Saint Crazies. Saint Pinnington's, a hospital where only the loved survive.

Mature: gruesome deaths, kissing and mention of gruesome violence (rape and death of unborn baby).

**Inspiration comes from Alice Cooper's album ""FROM THE INSIDE"" and after writing this, I believe it's in the same vain as ""ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST"".**

Screenwriting,LEARN How To Take Feedback.,"No seriously, learn how to take feedback. I'm not joking.

I put a post on here a few weeks back asking for scripts to give feedback on, and was instantaneously swarmed by an overwhelming amount of them. Any other man would just back down, but I guess I'm just different. (I've got 1000+ pages to go through, I promise I'll get to yours.)

Back to the main message here, learn how to take feedback.

I know you gave me your baby to look over, and I gave it back and told you it was ugly, but I promise I found the nicest words I could use to tell you that.

Feedback isn't easy to take, hell, I bite my tongue to read through it and not give up. What I definitely don't do is question every piece of it, and argue why the feedback is wrong. So...

Learn how to take feedback. I can't stress this enough.

I know it's not all of you, it's actually not a lot of you, but it's a very vocal minority. Typically, the best scripts took the feedback better than the people who really needed it. And the people who needed it claimed I was ""being an as***le"" and I ""didn't understand the story"". Truth be told, I didn't understand the story, because you wrote a horrible story.

In all honesty, I'm not a cruel editor, I'm not even all that blunt about it. I believe all stories are great stories, but some of them haven't reached their full potential. Here's the thing, if there's people rewriting their scripts, because there was a spelling error on page three, why can't you just accept that your script isn't going to win all the Oscars?

Coming back to the whole point of this, learn how to take feedback. If you don't want feedback, don't ask for it. If you're expecting praise for your script, don't write anything in the first place.

On that note, those writers who are able to grit their teeth and move through the feedback. Thank you."

I consider that the best way to understand something it's with examples and practice, but all of the lists I've found comparing Plot-driven and Character-driven stories include movies that I haven't heard of, or just haven't analyzed enough. So I thought of asking about Studio Ghibli movies since I've watched them all countless times. I'm sure this list will help a lot of storytellers to finally understand this topic.

Screenwriting,Advice for someone who writes often but has no connections,"Hello fellow reader/writer!

Allow me to start by saying that I have already looked into this subreddit and read a lot of posts on this matter, and that this post is a sort of 'reply' to what I've gleaned from them. I hope you'll forgive me for adding to the pile.

The context: I've been writing for almost 4 years, screenwriting for 2+. I don't expect to be great at it, but I do believe I am as passionate as one should be in this ""line of work"". Namely, I try to write 5 days a week for roughly 3 hours, with the goal of finishing 4 feature-length screenplays per year. I am a recent university graduate with a couple of short films under my belt; that said, I got rejected by all the MFAs in Film Production I applied to. Thus, I find myself 'limited' to writing every night after work, hoping to eventually land the oh-so-coveted, marketable script.

My question to you, should you choose to accept it, is: must I rely on placing/winning a contest/festival/fellowship in order to get a ""big break""?

From what I've read on this subreddit, other than ""write, write, write"" and ""read screenplays"" (two things I'm actively doing), the only other realistic advice for people like me is to try to be a part of that 2-5% that reaches the Quarter-, Semi-, or Finals in a big-name competition and gets contacted by a  producer/manager/agent.

So I thought I'd ask, what other (realistic) avenues to success are there for those who don't know a single working professional?

Thank you for reading this far and thank you, in advance, for commenting (if you do).

Yeah, I know the FBI character will usually say something along the lines of, “We never would have gotten him without you!” or something, but it just feels unnecessary. It’s supposed to be a twist, so it’s just tacked on at the end as an ex machina or an afterthought. It just feels cheap."

Screenwriting,"New Blacklist Review: 6 for ""Smoker","I always enjoy reading others' evaluations on here, the good and the bad, so I just wanted to share my latest evaluation. I found some of the takeaways strange, like the magical stuff, but even the stuff I don't connect to or fully relate to, I still find very helpful. So, a good evaluation.

Logline

A mysterious woman misses her train on her way to deliver a mysterious package and spends a night in a small seaside town fighting to avoid becoming the tight-knit community's monthly human sacrifice.

Strengths

This fast-moving horror with a tough criminal Latina protagonist is a well-thought-out take on a classic “creepy small town” slasher film. The ticking clock of the overnight wait for a train provides a strong structure. The mysterious bag Juana must deliver to her dangerous employer is the ultimate MacGuffin, forcing her to return to a dangerous situation and establishing that she’s probably skilled in defending herself, thereby making the action more believable. The story is tightly constructed in many important respects. Juana accidentally takes Guy’s bracelet with her when she runs, uses it, and leaves it for someone to whom she behaved differently, completing a well-shaped character arc. There are some laugh-out-loud, original moments in the story.

Weaknesses

While this project is shootable as-is and has standout moments, it could be more compelling with some allegorical layering in the story. Why are there monsters in this town? What do they represent? Finding a way to unlock a more compelling thematic core or symbolism of the film could also unlock answers to other distracting questions. For instance, why do the monsters continue attacking after they’ve eaten at least three people? Also, if a traveler disappears in this town every month, why aren't the cops all over it? It doesn’t appear that the townspeople specifically target those who “won’t be missed”. With a number of ""ritual sacrifice"" horror film specs available at the moment, this needs to be best of breed to succeed. The setting is well-evoked, but it seems odd that – if this is set in the present day - Juana doesn’t just use a burner phone or Telegram instead of relying on finding a working payphone. Perhaps her phone doesn't work, because this town is magical. Leon should perhaps try a little harder to warn Juana not to go to the town. She might still ignore him, considering she’s trained to defend herself. Alternatively, perhaps Leon’s in on it all, or perhaps the town and train station are both able to disappear and reappear magically. There are certainly suggestions in the story that the town itself may be a ghost.

Prospects:

This genuinely funny, short, and amusingly sick horror is an impressive writing sample, showcasing smart writing with a knack for comedy. The story issues mentioned could be easily solved in a targeted revision. Because of the many fight scenes involving monsters, this is likely to be a big-budget horror despite its simple locations and limited cast."

Screenwriting,Learn how to GIVE feedback.,"This is going to be long, and I am typing on a mobile, so please forgive any typos – I’ll fix them when I’m stationary.

I see another post on “how to take feedback” has made it to the top of r/screenwriting. In the years I’ve been a part of this community, I have not seen one on how to GIVE criticism – which, frankly, is a skill we’re all going to need all of our lives. So – here is how I approach critique in general, and critique in screenwriting specifically.  Hope it give you all a few more tools.

All critique needs to be specific, actionable, and focused on the end objective.  I highly encourage you to watch these two vids which do a great job of walking through the process and providing a larger context:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqh1MRWZjms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqh1MRWZjms)
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWMH_X4IvOk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWMH_X4IvOk)

Ron Berger emphasizes “being kind” as a necessary part of critique. Why is this important to you, o screenplay critiquer? Because creative people quickly blackball jerks, and you can irreversibly kill networking opportunities. Additionally, you job as a critiquer is to help the screenwriter in creating a better product, not to voice your personal likes and dislikes.  Last, and most importantly – finding kind language forces you to become *specific* in your assessment, which makes YOU a better writer. “Value judgment” language isn't productive in any situation. Eliminating it will help others, and it will help YOU as you wrestle with any creative endeavor.

On to screenplay critiquing specifically.

When I agree to read an author’s screenplay, I ask that they send me their screenplay and the logline. My job as a reviewer is not to tell the author if I “liked” the work, but instead to tell them if they screenplay successfully fulfilled the goals of the logline. Sometimes, if the logline seems to be about a genre or storyline that I don’t have much experience with or flat out don’t enjoy, I politely defer and suggest that they look for someone who has a better background in their particular style of work. Otherwise, I’m about as effective as a gymnastics coach giving pointers on a pitcher’s form.: my skillset is adjacent, but probably not specific enough to what the end goal is.

Sometimes, I end up doing critiques in steps: if I see a lot of typos and formatting errors, I’ll point out a few on the first few pages, send it back, and ask the author to re-send once those are fixed. Sometimes I get a revised draft back; sometimes not. But it helps me conserve my time, and helps build a better relationship with those people who do send back a fixed draft.

When I’m reading the first few pages, I look to see if the author has answered these questions: Where are we? Why are we here? What are the stakes? How high are the stakes?

From there, I read through the rest of the screenplay with a specific set of questions in mind – What is each line of action or dialog “doing”? What function does it have **for the story**? That is, is it moving the story forward? Is it giving the audience more information about a character, or the relationship between characters? Is it “showing” the audience how they should feel about the information that was just revealed?

From here, it’s kind of “kicking the tires” – Is this action the BEST way to achieve the purpose of this scene? What are other options? Is this piece of dialog REALLY necessary? Can the emotion/response you are trying to communicate happen with a shrug? A facial expression? Through an action?  Does this choice support production at a $50M budget as well as a $250M budget (for those who want to be produced). Screenwriting, like directing, is all about problem solving: it’s finding the BEST way to convey information to the audience.

Last, I note problematic areas. On my list are reliance on tropes, stereotyping, dialog that sounds like you’ve never spoken to a woman/child/scientist; important characters that just seem to be there as “warm props” (think – women in a lot of movies). I look for dialog or motivations that do not seem to “ring true”, from my experience of IRL interacting with a wide array of people from a vast body of cultural and economic backgrounds. I also have a flat-out rule: do not write in sex workers unless you have actually KNOWN sex workers outside of their professional capacity.

Ultimately, my goals as a critiquer are to reflect back if the script fulfilled its purpose; if the characters are believable (within the limits of the type of story it is), if the screenwriter has defaulted to “lazy” storytelling rather than wrestling with finding a more nuanced and creative way to express the needs of the scene; and last, to report back if the information necessary to tell the story is presented in a clear and compelling way.

Basically, I try to point out where more work is needed as opposed to what I personally didn’t like – with kindness.

NOTE: I’ve been thinking about starting a Twitch stream where I read through scripts that people send me (with their consent) and go over the first few pages with these questions in mind. If there is interest in that here, let me know."
Screenwriting,Joker &amp; Harley Quinn (Glenn Ficarra and John Requa),"Anyone have it? Really curious to see how it would have turned out. Here is an article talking about it.

Screenwriting,Script offer - feedbacks ?,"Hi everyone,

I got an offer from a producer on my 5 years old script and I would love to get your feedbacks !

He offered me 0,5% of the total budget (minimum budget 1 million USD), I precise it is a DTV movie.

he told me there are significant rewritings to do (2 other cowriters he used to working with will take care of these rewritings meaning I get 50% of the writing budget and they get 25-25)

No back end deal as he said it is a low budget movie. (I think the final budget is between 1.2 - 1.5 millions)

Do you think it is fair ?

Thanks a lot for your help !"
Screenwriting,"For those of you who write in your spare time and work minimum wage paying jobs or 9-to-5's, how &amp; when do you find time to write?","I work at a grocery store and my hours are typically 8am-4pm. Usually I'm a big morning person, but when it comes to writing, I never feel like I can fit in a good writing sesh. I'm foggy, too stressed about getting to work on time to write anything meaningful, and anyways I like using that time to get a workout in. My problem is that by the time my shift is done and I get home around 5, shower, eat, etc., I'm so exhausted that I can never motivate myself to write. And even if I'm not exhausted, there always seems to be something else to do--laundry, meal prep, homework, roommates need friend therapy, calls from parents, etc. Some nights I can manage a couple pages, but most times I push the task to the weekend. Then the week goes by, pages blank. 

I've had shifts that go from 3pm-11pm, which gives me a lot more morning time to write, but I find that I run into the same problem of not being able to switch my brain into dramatic-story-mode fresh out of bed. 

Does anyone else have difficulty balancing writing time with paying-the-rent time (or just general busyness)? In an ideal world, they'd be the same thing, but I don't come from a lot of money and right now I have to prioritize paying the bills + school. I feel like my biggest challenge as a writer is just prioritizing/finding time. Was anyone able to convert to a morning writer? Or do 30 minute segments at night or something? I often feel like I need to be in a deep, deep headspace to really get into writing, but maybe I'm just telling myself that to subconsciously procrastinate. Let me know!"
Screenwriting,Writing a script based on stock footage,"I haven't heard anyone else try this but I've been working on my improv skills by writing short stories based on available stock footage. It started off as individual comedic scenes where I would come up with the dialogue for the actors/models in the stock footage, but I soon became more accustomed to each actor's scenes (i.e. I would see an actor playing a scene as an abussive husband, then a friendly manager in another scene) and I would inevitably try to create an arching narrative for that character based on the actor's scenes.

I got to a point now where I have created many different stories for random characters who don't interact with each other. I come to you, creative folks, asking what would be a good excuse to blend these stories together into a feature length story? My options so far have been either creating a sort of dystopian future where everyone is assigned a ""role"" to perform in front of the camera, thus creating stock footage, or a story where people connect to a sort of VR and are able to role-play the lives of these stock footage actors. 

If you're wondering why I would punish myself by writing based on available footage, it's because I think it's a comedy goldmine to take these amateur actors and give their characters a bigger purpose than playing in generic corporate stock footage. Also, it's been a ton of fun, which I'd recommend anyone try out. I should add that I have also been editing these clips together in hopes that I'll upload the final story online - I know, I know, it's been a looong year."
Screenwriting,In regards to the Powerpuff script.,"I'm not going to lie, it's pretty bad. Everyone who reads it will get that. But try to be a little nicer. 

I read the script from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/nl0wir/anyone_have_the_link_to_the_cws_power_puff_girls/) and the whole time I was just terrified thinking what if I wrote something that would get received this bad and not know it? Then I remembered I have written scripts that were actually far worse. Scripts that make the Powerpuff pilot look like Citizen Kane. 

Point is let's be a little more kind when breaking down people's work. I get that the guys who wrote it are in the industry and they got paid so boo-hoo, etc, etc. But they're still people. People whose work is being shamed on a public level due to the re-filming being announced and the exec's statement. 

I'm one of those people who get a physical reaction to a bad tv-show or film, so I understand what it's like to want to completely shit on a bad piece of work, but I think in this sub we're intelligent enough to be able to break down and constructively criticize a script, without completely demolishing somebody else's hard work. 

I refer y'all to Bojack Horseman, Season 2, Episode 10: ""Yes And"". 

Always remember that one man's ""piece of shit"" is another man's ""Casablanca""."
Screenwriting,Complete Beat by Beat Breakdown &amp; Analysis of Whiplash By Damien Chazelle for Study,"I used Lucid Chart to create a complete outline of the film Whiplash. I hope that this can be useful for anyone that wants to visually see how all the moving parts of story work together in one cohesive piece of art.

If you haven't seen Whiplash it's about "" A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory  where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will  stop at nothing to realize a student's potential.""

The story is simple yet heavily complex at the same time. I have been struggling to dramatize modern life, and I thought Whiplash could help me understand how to build and tell a story about the ""real world,"" due to the fact that the real world (modern American life) is inherently bland when it comes to drama.

So, main questions that I wanted to find answers to:

1. How do you generate conflict in a realistic manner, but that is also different and compelling?
2. How do you set up stakes that feel like metaphorical life in death, since most people in the real world are not in literal life and death situations?
3. How do you maintain pacing that is engaging when dealing with subject matter that doesn't have conflict pouring out of the page such as the action/superhero genre?
4. How do you simply make an outline for a feature film?

This outline shows:

1. The interweaving of the main plotline and a romantic b-story.
2. Act breakdowns with clear transitions: 12 min setup of Act 1 and then subsequent 3 Acts roughly 30 mins long.
3. How theme is intercut throughout the film.
4. Where to and how long your character setup should be.
5. Visually see the setups and payoffs within  Acts and where to put ""Action/Battle Sequences"" (for this film they are the drumming scenes""
6. Screenshots of the film allow you to see how color is used between scenes and sequences to show change. For example: The majority of b-story and transitional/expositional scenes are teal while drumming Andrew-focused scenes are orange.
   1. Also, these screenshots show you a storyboard of the whole film.
7. 60 Scenes outlined with 60 index cards that have important dialogue and themes highlighted for study.
8. A visual example of my method of outlining a film scene by scene, beat by beat.

Screenwriting,Finding Time to Write &amp; Day Jobs for Screenwriters,"Several people have posted about this recently, so here's a blog I wrote on the topic.  


Almost all big-time professional screenwriters worked at something else for years before they made their first dollar from screenwriting, and/or had long dry spells between screenwriting gigs.

* [Kenneth Lonergan](https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/screenwriting/kenneth-lonergan-process-writing/) (*Manchester-by-the-Sea*) wrote industrial shows and speeches for the regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
* [Tony Gilroy](https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/screenwriting/tony-gilroy-interview/) (*Michael Clayton*) was a musician and tended bar.
* [Dan Gillroy](https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/screenwriting/finding-the-human-dan-gilroy-talks-roman-j-israel-esq/) (*Nightcrawler*) was an admin for a theatrical producer and wrote for *Variety*.
* [Eli Attie](https://creativescreenwriting.com/eli-attie-from-the-white-house-to-the-west-wing/) (*House*, *The West Wing*) wrote speeches for Bill Clinton and Al Gore.

How can you get stuff written when you’ve got a day job, and maybe family responsibilities as well?

The obvious answers are:

* Get up early or stay up late
* Write on weekends
* Write during your breaks and lunch hours
* Write on vacation
* Write on the job – if it’s OK with your boss (see below)
* Write during your commute – as long as you’re not driving

I wrote the first ten pages of my first screenplay under idyllic conditions – on a porch overlooking a meadow next to a creek at my in-laws’ off-the-grid ranch high in the mountains of Southern Wyoming.  I had three kids under six at the time, but there were lots of relatives around to prevent them from falling in the creek.

I wrote the rest of the first draft in a spiral notebook on the subway on the way to and from my lawyer job in downtown LA. Then I wrote my second draft in Final Draft while taking a rewrite class at UCLA Extension.

## Day Jobs

Finding screenwriting time when you’ve got a day job is especially important, since it’s [highly unlikely](https://lauridonahue.com/tell-me-the-odds-stps-2/) you’ll ever be able to support yourself from screenwriting alone.

What kinds of day jobs are best for screenwriters? There are many possibilities:

* Jobs that are very undemanding and allow you to write on the job. For example, I once had a summer office job that required only about 30 minutes a day of actual work. The rest of the time I was free to write.
* Freelance jobs that pay well on an hourly basis, so you don’t have to work too many hours to support yourself and can spend the rest of your time writing.
* Jobs in the entertainment industry that expose you to contacts who can get you gigs (although these are often low-paying and exhausting).
* Jobs that involve writing of any kind, so you can get better at it.
* Jobs that develop your expertise in an area (e.g., the military, espionage, law, law enforcement, medicine, etc.) so that you can write about it realistically. You can also market this expertise to potential clients.

The worst type of job for an aspiring small-time professional screenwriter is:

* low-paying,
* physically and/or mentally exhausting, and
* unconnected with writing or entertainment

If you’re stuck in a “worst” job, you could focus on getting a “best” one as part of your screenwriter career path.

## Reclaiming Your Screen Time

If you don’t think you have time to write, check how much time you’re spending farting around on your phone every day.

iPhones have the Screen Time function, and there are lots of apps that can measure how much time you’re frittering away.

You can set Screen Time limits and use apps like Forest (simultaneously, if needed) to break your [phone addiction](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/addictions/smartphone-addiction.htm/) and free up your time and mental bandwidth for writing.

## Hitting a Deadline

One nice thing about [screenwriting contests, labs, etc](https://lauridonahue.com/resources/a-curated-list-of-the-most-worthwhile-screenwriting-fellowships-labs-and-contests/). is that they have deadlines, which can be very motivating for some people.

Taking a class, finding a writing buddy, or joining a writing group (where you’re scheduled to present your pages for discussion on a specific day) can also compel you to get work done.

There’s also [WRAC](https://www.scriptmag.com/features/career-features/writing-routine-career-features/wrac-launches-community-for-writer-accountability):

i don't have a manager or lawyer and know i need to contact a lawyer before signing anything, but i'm just wondering if i should try reaching out to managers right now? i've never done so before b/c it kind of always felt like a long shot, but i'm wondering if i'll have a better chance now that a producer is attached to one of my scripts?  do i include that in the query?

I wrote a little exercise short script so that I could practice screwball comedy writing. I've been watching a lot of Howard Hawk (His Girl Friday, Ball of Fire) and Billy Wilder (The Apartment, Fortune Cookie) films lately so I wanted to take a swing at modernizing the now most died out genre that is screwball (fast pace dialogue, a lot of movement from actors in one location, the masculine/feminine tension, etc.) The logline is:

A New Yorker and a Los Angelean get to know one another over dinner and strange conversation.

I kind of like the result of this exercise script though and might look to possibly sell it at a future draft, but my biggest insecurity is the dialogue. Does it sound MODERN, REALISTIC, COHESIVE, WELL DELIVERED, and most of all FUNNY?

Screenwriting,The classic catch .22 of not being able to get a job without having previously had a job is seriously limiting options and I really don't know what the right move is,"I've just about graduated with a film production degree in the UK, I'm now looking for a job. I thought the surge of work from home careers would be useful and have been looking at script editor/copy writing jobs but all of them want years of experience.

My concern is how do I get experience in order to get these jobs if there's no jobs hiring without? Is there ways I can get into script editing or copy writing off my own back or any materials I could read or use to step in.

I'm thinking I could edit random scripts online on something like fiverr to get some practice in but that seems like it could be counterproductive. I'm just not sure what to do and we weren't told about it at uni"
Screenwriting,"I hate being asked what my ""favorite"" movie is or ""favorite"" script/screenwriter.","Just a mild rant but honestly I feel like there's something quite annoying with the assumption that everyone has to have a ""favorite"" something.

Every writer i usually claim as my favorite when i need to, has probably only written one thing i truly enjoyed. But i feel like saying something like ""John Doe is my favorite writer"" means i am reading and watching everything he creates. No. He just made that one movie i really enjoy and it's influenced me a lot. I have no clue what else he does or maybe i am not interested in whatever else he has created.

Idk. It's so odd, I know. But lowkey it just bothers me. I feel like an asshole having to explain i dont really have a favorite movie or favorite writer, i just have a list of things i enjoy.

I feel like it makes me sound snooty.

Anyway, i am about to lie on an application asking me for my favorite writer and movies. Just wanted to get that off my chest."

Screenwriting,Best designation for character speaking through electronic devices?,"Hi everyone. I'm finishing up a spec for the Warner Bros fellowship, and have a quick question about formatting (FOX, half-hour animated comedy).


If a character is never shown on screen, and speaking through a radio or telephone, what is the proper way to write that?

RANDOM DUDE (V.O.)? 


Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer my question."
Screenwriting,"Writing ""That's my girl"" in a Non-creepy Way","The context:

My character is a father who has just dropped his teenage daughter off at high school. She has just told him about her first boyfriend and he is, naturally, a little over-protective. As he watches her walk to the entrance he sees a young man (presumably the aforementioned boyfriend) wrap an arm around her and decides to startle him by honking the horn.

All the kids turn to look at the father, except for his daughter, who just gives him the finger over her shoulder without breaking stride.

The problem:

I would like for him to say ""That's my girl"" -- as in, *The apple doesn't fall far from the tree*.

However, saying ""That's my girl,"" especially in this context, can also be read as *Hands off, interloper! She belongs to me!*

So what's the best way to write this in a way that emphasizes the first meaning, while decreasing the odds that a reader will arrive at the second meaning?

So far I've got four possibilities, neither of which seems sufficiently satisfactory (or maybe I'm just way too thick into the weeds at this point):

A.)

FATHER

That's my girl...

B.)

FATHER

That's my girl.

C.)

FATHER

(paternally)

That's my girl.

D.)

FATHER

That's m'girl.

Any other suggestions?

Particularly with regard to alternates in the parenthetical in option (C.)

What about other lines of dialog?"

Screenwriting,"Am a newbie, i have a rough story in my mind which i think would be great had it been like a short movie or something . But am just finding it hard to put my thoughts together in order to write it as a script.","So, i do have a great story in my mind partly inspired by some incidents in my life along with fictionalising as to how i would have wanted it to be.

I am just wondering whether it would be a good idea to partner with someone who can i work along to  like put it in words as a script because when you like put it as a script it takes a new life and having another person would just enhance the whole thing. But, i do know that at a point i might loose out on what i am trying to say by making the story to seem like a jumbled pieces of a puzzle cause TWO PEOPLE = TWO WHOLE DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES, it is very rare for people's life stories contemplating with each other. 

Also where can i find spaces wherein people rate my story? Can you like suggest me some subs where i can share my *idea of a script* in parts like a series?"
Screenwriting,"Script start is meant to be monotonous, is this a bad thing?","I'm writing a screenplay right now but I'm running into a problem. I've finished the first draft and am in the second draft stage but thought about a problem at the start. The start of my story is meant to show the monotony that an old man goes through, but this also goes against the whole rule of trying to hook the reader in the first few pages. Should I leave it as it is? There is a slight bit of mystery I have put in but it's only a line or two."

Screenwriting,"Script Editors - Melbourne, Victoria AUS","Hi Team,

Request aimed at people residing in Melbourne, Victoria AUS if possible.   


Been working on my feature for 2+ years now; rev. after rev. after rev.   
I just can't look at the thing any longer, I need someone to professionally read it. I was wondering if anyone had any idea on a good, honest editor to reach out to?

I am sitting at around 120 pgs. Give or take. 

I think it's so ready I just want someone's professional opinion. I would ask my girl though I worry she has been too close to it through the time I have been writing and it's very personal and close to my heart, my experiences, my friends and family. I worry I will jar them.   


I just want Anon. to look at it, blank page; just to see if he/she/they are taking to the emotion. When I say Anon., I am looking for someone with a few tickets under their belt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope to hear soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers."
