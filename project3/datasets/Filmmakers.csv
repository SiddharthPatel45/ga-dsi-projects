# **1. Should I Pursue Filmmaking / Should I Go To Film School?**


This is a very complex topic, so it will rely heavily on *you* as a person. Find below a guide to help you identify what you need to think about and consider when making this decision.

##Do you want to do it?

Alright, real talk. If you want to make movies, you'll at least have a few ideas kicking around in your head. Successful creatives like writers and directors have an internal compunction to create something. They get ideas that stick in the head and compel them to translate them into the real world. Do you want to make films, or do you want to *be seen as* a filmmaker? Those are two extremely different things, and you need to be honest with yourself about which category you fall into. If you like the idea of being called a filmmaker, but you don't actually have any interest in making films, then now is the time to jump ship. I have many friends from film school who were just into it because they didn't want ""real jobs"", and they liked the idea of working on flashy movies. They made some cool projects, but they didn't have that internal drive to create. They saw filmmaking as a task, not an opportunity. None of them have achieved anything of note and most of them are out of the industry now with college debt but no relevant degree. If, when you walk onto a set you are overwhelmed with excitement and anxiety, then you'll be fine. If you walk onto a set and feel foreboding and anxiety, it's probably not right for you. Filmmaking should be fun. If it isn't, you'll never make it.

##School

Are you planning on a film production program, or a film studies program? A studies program isn't meant to give you the tools or experience necessary to actually make films from a craft-standpoint. It is meant to give you the analytical and critical skills necessary to dissect films and understand what works and what doesn't. A would-be director or DP will benefit from a program that mixes these two, with an emphasis on production.

Does your prospective school have a film club? The school I went to had a filmmakers' club where we would all go out and make movies every semester. If your school has a similar club then I highly recommend jumping into it. I made 4 films for my classes, and shot 8 films. In the filmmaker club at my school I was able to shoot 20 films. It vastly increased my experience and I was able to get a lot of the growing pains of learning a craft out of the way while still in school.

How are your classes? Are they challenging and insightful? Are you memorizing dates, names, and ideas, or are you talking about philosophies, formative experiences, cultural influences, and milestone achievements? You're paying a huge sum of money, more than you'll make for a decade or so after graduation, so you better be getting something out of it.

**Film school is always a risky prospect. You have three decisive advantages from attending school:**

1. Foundation of theory (why we do what we do, how the masters did it, and how to do it ourselves)
2. Building your first network
3. Making mistakes in a sandbox

Those three items are the *only* advantages of film school. It doesn't matter if you get to use fancy cameras in class or anything like that, because I guarantee you that for the price of your tuition you could've rented that gear and made your own stuff. The downsides, as you may have guessed, are:

1. Cost
- Risk of no value
- Cost again

Seriously. Film school is insanely expensive, especially for an industry where you really don't make any exceptional money until you get established (and that can take a decade or more). 

So there's a few things you need to sort out:

- How much debt will you incur if you pursue a film degree?
- How much value will you get from the degree? (any notable alumni? Do they succeed or fail?)
- Can you enhance your value with extracurricular activity?

##Career Prospects

Don't worry about lacking experience or a degree. It is easy to break into the industry if you have two qualities: 

 - The ability to listen and learn quickly
 - A great attitude

In LA we often bring unpaid interns onto set to get them experience and possibly hire them in the future. Those two categories are what they are judged on. If they have to be told twice how to do something, that's a bad sign. If they approach the work with disdain, that's also a bad sign. I can name a few people who walked in out of the blue, asked for a job, and became professional filmmakers within a year. One kid was 18 years old and had just driven to LA from his home to learn filmmaking because he couldn't afford college. Last I saw he has a successful YouTube channel with nature documentaries on it and knows his way around most camera and grip equipment. He succeeded because he smiled and joked with everyone he met, and because once you taught him something he was good to go. Those are the qualities that will take you far in life (and I'm not just talking about film).

So how do you break in?

- *Cold Calling*
  - Find the production listings for your area (not sure about NY but in LA we use the BTL Listings) and go down the line of upcoming productions and call/email every single one asking for an intern or PA position. Include some humor and friendly jokes to humanize yourself and you'll be good. I did this when I first moved to LA and ended up camera interning for an ASC DP on movie within a couple months. It works!
- *Rental House*
  - Working at a rental house gives you free access to gear and a revolving door of clients who work in the industry for you to meet.
- *Filmmaking Groups*
  - Find some filmmaking groups in your area and meet up with them. If you can't find groups, don't sweat it! You have more options.
- *Film Festivals*
  - Go to film festivals, meet filmmakers there, and befriend them. Show them that you're eager to learn how they do what they do, and you'd be happy to help them on set however you can. Eventually you'll form a fledgling network that you can work to expand using the other avenues above.

##What you should do right now

Alright, enough talking! You need to decide now if you're still going to be a filmmaker or if you're going to instead major in something safer (like business). It's a tough decision, we get it, but you're an adult now and this is what that means. You're in command of your destiny, and you can't trust anyone but yourself to make that decision for you.

Once you decide, own it. If you choose film, then take everything I said above into consideration. There's one essential thing you need to do though: create. Go outside right fucking now and make a movie. Use your phone. That iphone or galaxy s7 or whatever has better video quality than the crap I used in film school. Don't sweat the gear or the mistakes. Don't compare yourself to others. Just make something, and watch it. See what you like and what you don't like, and adjust on your next project! Now is the time for you to do this, to learn what it feels like to make a movie.

#**2. What Camera Should I Buy?**

The answer depends mostly on your budget and your intended use. You'll also want to become familiar with some basic camera terms because it will allow you to efficiently evaluate the merits of one option vs another. Find below a basic list of terms you should become familiar with when making your first (or second, or third!) camera purchase:

1. **Resolution** - This is how many pixels your recorded image will have. If you're into filmmaking, you probably already know this. An HD camera will have a resolution of 1920x1080. A 4K camera will be either 4096x2160 or 3840x2160. The functional difference is that the former is a theatrical aspect ratio while the latter is a standard HDTV aspect ratio (1.89:1 vs 1.78:1 respectively).
2. **Framerates** - The standard and popular framerate for filmmaking is called 24p, but most digital cameras will actually be shooting at 23.976 fps. The difference is negligible and should have no bearing on your purchasing choice. The technical reasons behind this are interesting but ultimately irrelevant. Something to look for is the camera's ability to shoot in **high framerate**, meaning anything above the 24p standard. This is useful because you can play back high framerate footage *at* 24p in your editor, and it will render the recorded motion in **slow motion**. This is obviously useful!
3. **Data Rate** - This tells you how much data is being recorded on a per second basis. Generally speaking, the higher the data rate, the better your image quality. Make sure to pay attention to resolution as well! A 1080p camera with a 100 MB/s data rate is going to be recording higher quality imagery than a 4k camera at a 200 MB/s data rate because the 4k camera has 4x as many pixels to record but only double the data bandwidth with which to do it. Things like compression come into play here, but keep this in mind as a rule of thumb.
4. **Compression** - Compression is important, because very few cameras will shoot without some form of compression. This is basically an algorithm that allows you to record high quality images without making large file sizes. This is intimately linked with your data rate. Popular cinema compressions for cameras include ProRes, REDCODE, XAVC, AVCHD. Compression schemes that you want to avoid include h.264, h.265, MPEG-4, and Generic 'MOV'. This is not an exhaustive list of compression types, but a decent starter guide.
5. **ISO** - This is your camera sensor's sensitivity to light. The higher the ISO number, the more sensitive to light the camera will be. Higher ISOs tend to give noisier images though, so there is a tradeoff. All cameras will have something called a **native iso**. This is the ISO at which the camera is deemed to perform the best in terms of trading off noise vs sensitivity. A very common native ISO in the industry is 800. Sony cameras, including the A7S boast much higher ISO performance without significant noise increases, which can be useful if you're planning on running and gunning in the dark with no crew.
6. **Manual Shutter** - Your shutter speed (or shutter angle, as it is called in the film industry) controls your motion blur by changing how long the sensor is exposed to light during a single frame of recording. Having manual control over this when shooting is important. The standard shutter speed when shooting 24p is 1/48 of a second (180° in shutter angle terms), so make sure your prospective camera can get here (1/50 is close enough).
7. **Lens Mount** - Some starter cameras will have built in lenses, which is fine for learning! When you move up to higher quality cameras however, the standard will be interchangeable lens cameras. This means you'll need to decide on what lens mount you would like to use. The professional standard is called the PL Mount, but lenses and cameras that use this mount are very expensive. The most common and popular mount in the low level professional world is Canon's EF mount. Because of its design, EF mount lenses can easily be adapted to other common mounts like Sony's E-Mount or the MFT mounts found on many Panasonic cameras. EF is popular because Canon's lenses are generally preferred over Sony's, and so their mount has a higher utility.
8. **Color Subsampling** - This is easier to understand if you think of it as 'Color Resolution'. Our eyes are more sensitive to luminance (bright vs dark) than to color, and so some cameras increase effective image quality by dedicating processing power and data rate bandwidth to the more important luminance values of individual pixels. This means that individual pixels often do not have their own color, but instead that *groups of neighboring pixels* will be given a single color value. The size of the groups and the pattern of their arrangement are referred to by 3 main color subsampling standards.
 - 4:4:4 means that each pixel has its own color value. This is the highest quality.
 - 4:2:2 means that color is set for horizontal pixels in pairs. The color of each two neighboring pixels is averaged and applied to both identically. This is the second best quality.
 - 4:2:0 means that color is set for both horizontal and vertical pixel 4-packs. Each square of 4 pixels receives a single color assignment that is an averaging of their original signals. This is generally low quality.
For more info on color subsampling, check out [this wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling)
9. **Bit-Depth** - This refers to how many colors the camera is capable of recognizing. An 8-bit camera can have 16,777,216 distinct colors, while a 10-bit camera can have 1,073,741,824 distinct colors. Note that this is primarily only of use when doing color grading, as nearly all TVs and computer monitors from the past few decades are 8-bit displays that won't benefit from a 10-bit signal.
10. **Sensor Size** - The three main sensor sizes you'll encounter (in ascending order) are **Micro Four-Thirds (M43), APS-C,** and **Full Frame**. A larger sensor will generally have better noise and sensitivity than a smaller sensor. It will also effect the field of view you get from a given lens. Larger sensors will have wider fields of view for the same focal length lenses. For example, a 50mm lens on a FF sensor will look roughly twice as wide-angle as a 50mm lens on a M43 sensor. To get the same field of view as a 50mm on FF, you'd need to use a 25mm lens on your M43 camera. *Theatrical 35mm (the cinema standard, so to speak) has an equivalent sensor size to* ***APS-C***, which is larger than M43 and smaller than Full Frame.

## So Now What Camera Should I Buy?

This list will be changing as new models emerge, but for now here is a short list of the cameras to look at when getting started:

1. [Panasonic G7 \(~$600\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1208931-REG/panasonic_lumix_dmc_g7_mirrorless_micro.html) - This is hands down the best starter camera for someone looking to move up from shooting on their phones or consumer camcorders.
2. [Panasonic GH4 \(~$1,500\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1185322-REG/panasonic_dmc_gh4_camera_body_black.html) - An older and cheaper version of the GH5, this camera is still a popular choice.
3. [Panasonic GH5 \(~$2,000\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1376491-REG/panasonic_lumix_dc_gh5_mirrorless_micro.html) - This is perhaps the most popular prosumer DSLR filmmaking camera.
4. [Sony A7S \(~$2,700\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1186034-REG/sony_ilce7sm2_b_alpha_a7sii_mirrorless_digital.html) - This is a very popular camera for shooting in low light settings. It also boasts a Full-Frame sensor (compared to the GH5's M4/3 sensor), allowing you to get shallower depth of field compared to other cameras using the same field of view and aperture.
5. [Canon C100 mkII \(~$3,500\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1086125-REG/canon_eos_c100_cinema_eos.html) - This is one of the cheapest true digital cinema cameras. It offers several benefits over the above DSLR cameras, such as professional level XLR audio inputs, internal ND filters, and a better picture profile system.

# **3. What Lens Should I Buy?**

Much like with deciding on a camera, lens choice is all about your budget and your needs. Below are the relevant specs to use as points of comparison for lenses.

1. **Focal Length** - This number indicates the field of view your lens will supply. A higher focal length results in a narrow (or more 'telescopic') field of view. [Here is a great visual depiction of focal length vs field of view](https://cdn-7.nikon-cdn.com/Images/Learn-Explore/Photography-Techniques/2009/Focal-Length/Media/red-barn-focal-lenght-rep-image.jpg).
2. **Speed** - A 'fast lens' is one with a very wide maximum aperture. This means the lens can let more light through it than a comparatively slower lens. We read the aperture setting via something called F-Stops. They are a standard scale that goes in alternating doublings of previous values. The scale is: 1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8, 4.0, 5.6, 8.0, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64. Each increase is a doubling of the incoming light. A lens whose aperture is a 1.4 will allow in twice as much light than it would have at 2.0. Cheaper lenses tend to only open up to a 4.0, or even a 5.6. More expensive lenses can open as far 1.3, giving you 16x as much light. Wider apertures also cause your depth of field to contract, resulting in the 'cinematic' shallow focus you're likely familiar with. [Here is a great visual depiction of f-stop vs depth of field](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/444004712_1280x720.jpg)
3. **Chromatic Aberration** - Some lower quality glass will have this defect, in which imperfect lens elements cause a prism-style effect that separates colors on the edges of image details. Post software can sometimes help correct this, as in [this example](https://cdn.photographylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Uncorrected-and-Corrected-CA.jpg)
4. **Sharpness** - I'm sure you all know what sharpness is. Cheaper lenses will yield a softer in-focus image than more expensive lenses. However, some lenses are popularly considered to be 'over-sharp', such as the Zeiss CP2 series. The minutia of the sharpness debate is mostly irrelevant at starter levels though.
5. **Bokeh** - This refers to the *shape* of an out of focus point of light as rendered by the lens. The bokeh of your image will always be in the shape of your aperture. For that reason, a perfectly round aperture will yield nice clean circle bokeh, while a rougher edged aperture will produce similarly rougher bokeh. [Here's an example](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/75/fd/6a/75fd6aba18cdb3fbe9780e3307b4874f.jpg)
6. **Lens Mount** - Make sure the lens you're buying will either fit your camera's lens mount or allow for adapting to is using a popular adapter like the Metabones. The professional standard lens mount is the PL Mount, but lenses and cameras that use this mount are very expensive. The most common and popular mount in the low level professional world is Canon's EF mount. Because of its design, EF mount lenses can easily be adapter to other common mounts like Sony's E-Mount or the MFT mounts found on many Panasonic cameras. EF is popular because Canon's lenses are generally preferred over Sony's, and so their mount has a higher market share.

##Zoom vs Prime
 This is all about speed vs quality vs budget. A zoom lens is a lens whose **focal length* can be changed by turning a ring on the lens barrel. A prime lens has a fixed focal length. Primes tend to be cheaper, faster, and sharper. However, buying a full set of primes can be more expensive than buying a zoom lens that would cover the same focal length range. Using primes on set in fast-paced environments can slow you down prohibitively. You'll often see news, documentary, and event cameras using zooms instead of primes. Some zoom lenses are as high-quality as prime lenses, and some people refer to them as 'variable prime' lenses. This is mostly a marketing tool and has no hard basis in science though. As you might expect, these high quality zooms tend to be very expensive.

##So What Lenses Should I Look At?
Below are the most popular lenses for 'cinematic' filming at low budgets:

1. [Rokinon Cine 4 Lens Kit in EF Mount \(~$1,700\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=rokinon%20cine&amp;N=0&amp;InitialSearch=yes&amp;sts=ma&amp;Top+Nav-Search=)
2. [Canon L Series 24-70mm Zoom in EF Mount \(~1,700\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/843008-USA/Canon_5175B002_EF_24_70mm_f_2_8L_II.html)
3. [Sigma Art 18-35mm Zoom in EF Mount \(~$800\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/967344-REG/sigma_18_35mm_f1_8_dc_hsm.html)
4. [Sigma Art 50-100 Zoom in EF Mount \(~$1,100\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1234029-REG/sigma_693954_50_100mm_f_1_8_dc_hsm.html)

Lenses below these average prices are mostly a crapshoot in terms of quality vs $, and you'll likely be best off using your camera's kit lens until you can afford to move up to one of the lenses or lens series listed above.

# **4. How Do I Learn Lighting?**

Alright, so you're biting off a big chunk here if you've never done lighting before. But it is doable and (most importantly) **fun**!

First off, *fuck three-point lighting*. So many people misunderstand what that system is supposed to teach you, so let's just skip it entirely. Light has **three properties**. They are:

* **Color**: Color of the light. This is both color temperature (on the Orange - Blue scale) and what you'd probably think of as regular color (is it RED!? GREEN!? AQUA!?) etc. Color. You know what color is.
* **Quantity**: How bright the light is. You know, the quantity of photons smacking into your subject and, eventually, your retinas.
* **Quality**: This is the good shit. The quality of a light source can vary quite a bit. Basically, this is how **hard** or **soft** the light is. Alright, you've got a guy standing near a wall. You shine a light on him. What's on the wall? His shadow, that's what. You know what shadows look like. A hard light makes his shadow super distinct with 'hard' edges to it. A soft light makes his shadow less distinct, with a 'soft' edge. When the sun is out, you get hard light. Distinct shadows. When it's cloudy, you get soft light. No shadows at all! So what makes a light hard or soft? Easy! **The size of the source, relative to the subject**. Think of it this way. You're the subject! Now look at your light source. How much of your field of vision is taken up by the light source? Is it a pinpoint? Or more like a giant box? The smaller the size of the source, the harder the light will be. You can take a hard light (i.e. a light bulb) and make it softer by putting **diffusion** in front of it. [Here is a picture of that happening](http://78.media.tumblr.com/7007ed96712236a6f446f094f946b8fa/tumblr_inline_o1qbhcoXA51rbs4ue_500.jpg). You can also **bounce** the light off of something big and bouncy, like a [bounce board](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Bounce_Board,_by_Brian_Finifter.jpg) or [a wall](http://st.houzz.com/simgs/feb1a53a01e178c6_4-1017/modern-wall-sconces.jpg). That's what sconces do. I fucking love sconces.

Alright, so there are your three properties of light. Now, how do you light a thing? Easy! Put light where you want it, and take it away from where you don't want it! Shut up! I know you just said ""I don't know where I want it"", so I'm going to stop you right there. Yes you do. I know you do because you can look at a picture and know if the lighting is good or not. You can recognize good lighting. Everybody can. The difference between knowing good lighting and *making* good lighting is simply in the execution.

Do an experiment. Get a lightbulb. Tungsten if you're oldschool, LED if you're new school, or CFL if you like mercury gas. plug it into something portable and movable, and have a friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, neighbor, creepy-but-realistic doll, etc. sit down in a chair. Turn off all the lights in the room and move that bare bulb around your ~~victim~~ subject's head. Note how the light falling on them changes as the light bulb moves around them. This is lighting, done live! Get yourself some diffusion. Either buy some overpriced or make some of your own (wax paper, regular paper, translucent shower curtains, white undershirts, etc.). Try softening the light, and see how that affects the subject's head. If you practice around with this enough you'll get an idea for how light looks when it comes from various directions. Three point lighting (well, all lighting) works on this fundamental basis, but so many 'how to light' tutorials skip over it. Start at the bottom and work your way up!

Ok, so cool. Now you know how light works, and sort of where to put it to make a person look a certain way. Now you can get creative by combining multiple lights. A very common look is to use soft light to primarily illuminate a person (the 'key) while using a harder (but sometimes still somewhat soft) light to do an edge or rim light. [Here's a shot](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/16600000/The-Shawshank-Redemption-the-shawshank-redemption-16632474-1600-900.jpg) from a sweet movie that uses a soft key light, a good amount of ambient ('errywhere) light, and a hard backlight. [Here](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/16600000/The-Shawshank-Redemption-the-shawshank-redemption-16632964-1600-900.jpg) they are lit ambiently, but still have an edge light coming from behind them and to the right. You can tell by the quality of the light that this edge was probably very soft. We can go on for hours, but if you just watch movies and look at shadows, bright spots, etc. you'll be able to pick out lighting locations and qualities fairly easily since you've been practicing with your light bulb!

## How Do I Light A Greenscreen?

Honestly, your greenscreen will depend more on your technical abilities in After Effects (or whichever program) than it will on your lighting. I'm a DP and I'm admitting that. A good key-guy (Keyist? Keyer?) can pull something clean out of a mediocre-ly lit greenscreen (like the ones in your example) but a bad key-guy will still struggle with a perfectly lit one. I can't help you much here, as I am only a mediocre key-guy, but I can at least give you advice on how to light for it!

Here's what you're looking for when lighting a greenscreen:

* **Two Separate Lighting Setups:** You should have a lighting setup for the green screen and a lighting setup for your actor. Of course, this isn't always possible. But we like to aspire to big things! The reason this is helpful is that it makes it easier for you to adjust the greenscreen light without affecting the actor's lighting, and vice versa.
* **Separate the subject from the greenscreen as much as possible!** - Pretty much that. The closer your subject is to the screen, the harder it is to keep lights from interfering with things they're not meant for, and the greater the chance the actor has of getting his filthy shadow all over the screen. I normally try to keep my subjects at least 8' away from the screen at a minimum for anything wider than an MCU.
* **Light the Green Screen EVENLY:** The green on the screen needs to be as close to the same intensity in all parts as possible, or you just multiply your work in post. For every different shade of green on that screen you'll need make a separate key effect to make clean edges, and then you'll need to matte and combine them all together. Huge headache that can be a tad overwhelming if you're not used it. For this reason, Get your shit even! *""But how do I do that?""* you ask! Well, first off, I actually prefer to use hard light. You see, hard light has the nice innate property of being able to throw itself a long distance without losing all its intensity. The farther away the light source is from the subject, the less its intensity will change from inch to inch. That's called the **inverse square law**, and it is cool as fuck. If you change the distance between the light and the subject, the intensity of the light will shift as an inverse to the square of the distance. Science! So if you double the distance between the light and the subject, the intensity is quartered (1 over 2 squared. 1/4). So, naturally, the farther away you are the more distance is required to reduce the intensity further. If you have the space, use it to your advantage and back your lights up! Now back to reality. You probably don't have a lot of space. You're probably in a garage. OK, fuck it, emergency mode! Now we use soft lights. Soft lights change their intensity quite inconveniently if they're at an oblique angle to the screen, but they kick ass if you can get them to shine more or less perpendicular on the screen. The problem there of course is that they'd then be sitting where your actor probably is. Sooo we move them off to the side, maybe put one on the ceiling, one on the ground too, and try to smudge everything together on the screen. Experiment with this for a while and you'll get the hang of it in no-time!
* **Have your background in mind *BEFORE* shooting:** Even if your key is flawless, it will look like shit if the actor isn't lit in a convincing manner compared to the background. If, for example, [this](http://i.imgur.com/pVWZ03G.jpg) for some reason is your background, you'll know that your actor needs a hard backlight from above and to camera right since we see a light source there. Also, we can infer from the lighting on the barrels that his main source of illumination should be from above him and pointing down, slightly from the right. You can move the source around and accent it as needed to make the actor not-ugly, but your background has provided you with some significant constraints right off the bat. For that reason, **pick your background before you shoot**, if possible. If it is not possible to do so, well, good luck! Guess as best as you can and try to find a good background.

## What Lights Should I Buy?

OK! So now you know sort of how to light a green screen and how to light a person. So now, what lights do you need? Well, really, you just need any lights. If you're on a budget, don't be afraid to get some work lights from home depot or picking up some off brand stuff on craigslist. By far the most important influence on the quality of your images will be **where and how you use the lights** rather than what types or brands of lights you are using. I cannot stress this enough. ***How* you use it will blow *what* you use out of the water**. Get as many different types of lights as you can for the money you have. That way you can do lots of sources, which can make for more intricate or nuanced lighting setups. I know you still want some hard recommendations, so I'll tell you this: Get china balls (china lanterns. Paper lanterns whatever the fuck we're supposed to call [these](http://www.filmtools.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/3/8/3877.JPG) now). They are wonderful soft lights, and if you need a hard light you can just take the lantern off and shine with the bare bulb! For bulbs, grab some 200W and 500W globes. You can check B&amp;H, Barbizon, Amazon, and probably lots of other places for these. Make sure you grab some high quality socket-and-wire sets too. You can find them at the same places. For brighter lights, like I said home depot construction lights are nice. You can also by PAR lamps relatively cheap. Try grabbing a few [Par Cans](http://www.greatneckgames.com/images/audio-visual-lighting/large/Par-Can-001.jpg). They're super useful and stupidly cheap. Don't forget to budget for some light stands as well, and maybe C-clamps and the like for rigging to things. I don't know what on earth you're shooting so it is hard to give you a grip list, but I'm sure you can figure that kind of stuff out without too much of a hassle.

# **5. What Editing Program Should I Use?**

Great question! There are several popular editing programs available for use.

## Free Editing Programs
Your choices are essentially limited to **[Davinci Resolve 14 \(Non-Studio\)](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/)** and **[Hitfilm Express](https://hitfilm.com/express)**. My personal recommendation is Davinci Resolve. This is the industry standard color-grading software, and you will have free access to many of its powerful tools. The Studio version costs a few hundred dollars and unlocks multiple features (like noise reduction) without forcing you to learn a new program.

## Paid Editing Programs

1. [**Avid Media Composer \($50/mo or $1,300 for life\)**](https://shop.avid.com/ccrz__Products?viewState=ListView&amp;cartID=&amp;categoryId=a3yi0000000011qAAA&amp;&amp;store=shop&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAu4nRBRBKEiwANms5W5aTpnsZUlCqfCPrO-E6gJnPP72AtyPKGqmTgHgRDzzq8h9le_T4jxoCu1EQAvD_BwE) - This is the high-level industry standard, but is not terribly popular unless you're working at a professional post-house for big budget movies.
2. [**Adobe Premiere Pro \($20/mo\)**](http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html?sdid=KKQOM&amp;mv=search&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!193588412835!e!!g!!adobe%20premiere%20pro&amp;ef_id=Wag6FgAABW8Ed9zc:20171202234138:s) - This is the most popular industry standard editor for low-high budget productions. If you want to be an editor, you need to know this program.
3. **[Davinci Resolve 14 Studio \($300\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1366318-REG/blackmagic_design_dv_resstud_davinci_resolve_stud_color.html)** - This is a decent editing program built into the long time industry-standard color grading suite. If you're big into color correction and grading, and your editing needs aren't wildly extreme, this is your best bet.
4. **[Final Cut Pro X \($300\)](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)** - This is the old standard for low-high budget editing, replaced now by Adobe Premiere. It is available on Mac platforms only, and is still a powerful editor despite several drawbacks compared to Premiere.

&amp;#x200B;

I was watching the interview with Robert Richardson about his work with Tarantino on ""Once upon a Time in Hollywood"" they said that in prep they studied a series of old television show in order to establish the look of the film... what I don't understand is the film looked nothing like these old television film? at all. Richardson still had his crazy intense backlight for both INT and EXT. the angles were the same as they always use, and the film was 2:35. 

Nothing they did seemed like an old 60s and 70s television show. what am i missing?"

Filmmakers,SmallHD 703 Monitor Output Settings,"I'm wondering if maybe the monitor we have is outdated in the firmware or maybe what I'm trying to do just won't work with the monitor.  I'm using a Sony FX3 with Anamorphic lenses(E mount to PL mount adapter).  The monitor is a SmallHD 703, inputting an HDMI feed from the camera.  We've created tools in a page for Crop and Scale, Aspect Ratio, Frame lines, etc. So you can monitor and operate the FX3 properly with the Anamorphic lenses.  

However, when outputting an image through BNC out of the monitor to a larger monitor, none of the tools we've created in the pages for the monitor are available in the output feed page from the 703(no proper framelines, aspect ratio, etc). When you try to add tools to the output page, you can only add a look or a gimbal overlay. 

Is there any way to output an image from the SmallHD 703 monitor with all the crop/scale, framelines, etc tools we created so a large monitor can show what the operator is seeing on the 703 monitor?  Or is the 703 limited in providing a way to mirror the settings into an output feed?"

Do you think it's still a solid contender as a workhorse documentary camera? I tend to er on the side of cinematic images more than videography, but I'm finding shooting on hybrid cameras a bit cumbersome for the fast shooting schedules I have nowadays.

I don't think I can afford the EVA-1, but has anyone got good firsthand experience with the DVX? How does it stack up against the GH5 etc?"

I need advice from you all regarding the film department at Sheffield Hallam University. 

I applied for MA in Filmmaking at Hallam and I made it through. I even got a scholarship of 3K. I am not a citizen of the UK so this scholarship has given me all the more reasons to consider Hallam over other universities. However, I have my doubts regarding Hallam's film department, which are as follows:

1. Is the film department good? I know that a degree does not ensure or guarantee a good job at any production house/firm anywhere, but I do believe that the name of the department/university matters significantly. 
2. Will there be enough networking opportunities available at Hallam? I am willing to go the extra mile to make connections, but if there is only limited exposure available then I need to re-consider my decision.
3. I have applied at universities like Queen's Belfast, Bristol (it's very expensive), Westminster (again, very expensive because of London) and Hertfordshire. I am still hoping to hear back from these universities, but for now I am seriously confused about Hallam.

Filmmakers,Question about Film Festival Submissions,"Hello fellow filmmakers,

I have produced (wrote, shot, directed, starred in, and edited) an adaptation of a popular science fiction/fantasy writer's short story for a college course. I also performed the same duties on an original story that prominently features copyrighted music in the first half and it would be more expensive than I can really afford to clear the usages, and more difficult to recreate the same tone as the current pieces of music. The sound design in the science fiction/fantasy adaptation would much easier to recreate. 

I don't want to sound too full of myself, but I really like what I made. Since I recently graduated, and am currently in between educations (I just received my bachelor's and intend on pursuing a Master's Degree) I thought it would be smart to try to submit some of my short films that I think are particularly good to various film festivals to try get my work out there.

Problem is, I don't know what the legal implications and ramifications of trying to submit an adaptation of a written work or one with use of copyrighted music to a film festival are. I was curious if anyone has any insights/suggestions/warnings for someone new to submitting shorts to film festivals.

Summary:

• I am a young filmmaker.
• I want to try to submit some short works to film festivals.
• I have two films I am considering.
• One film is an adaptation of a short story of which I don't have the rights.
• The other prominently features copyrighted music.
• I don't have much money.

Questions:

• Which of the two films would be a simpler task to completely legally submit to a film festival?

• What advice can you provide a young filmmaker wanting to begin film festivals submission? (Once the obligatory ""Don't get into show biz, kid."" routine falls flat)"
Filmmakers,"Battlefield 5 Trailer has one of the cleanest Continuous shots, What you think ?",
Filmmakers,A Couple Questions for Producers.,"What’s the most important element you look for when considering taking on new projects? I’ve always been curious. 

Does the person have to have some sort of name-recognition? Or is a referral more likely to get you involved? 

Also, if someone unknown were to come to you with a project they’re trying to fund, what exactly do you NEED to hear before you’re fully comfortable investing your time, energy, and resources into the project? 

I get that there’s differences that vary depending on projects. So I’ll be specific: 

I’m writing a Pilot script for a story that I’ve been working on and developing for seven years now. If I were to present you with an excellent script, an immensely detailed bible, and a well-organized and exciting pitch deck; all wrapped up in a story that you enjoy/think is profitable, what else would you need to hear? Or is it all fruitless because I’m an unknown? 

That last question isn’t meant to be condescending or patronizing. It’s more or less an insecurity that I’m concerned about.  

Would a proof of concept make you feel more comfortable with your investment? I get those kinds of films are more geared towards features, but I was just wondering if having a short, visual look at the potential of the project would pique interest.

Thanks guys!"
Filmmakers,"17 yo, first-time filmmaker here... would appreciate any and all feedback!","Here's the film: [Optical Illusion](https://youtu.be/WIFrI03jY70)

Anyway, I'm a junior in high school and this is the first film I've ever made.

Writing a screenplay for this project was a very new experience for me, and as I transitioned over to production, I learned a lot about how the role and vision of a director truly do impact the film as a whole. I also had to act the main part, which was not a part of the original plan, but I had to work with what I had. I also edited and scored the film.

Overall, the experience was very helpful to a first-timer such as myself and while this production was very limited and home-grown, I feel much more confident and understanding of what that process can feel like.

I would really appreciate any sort of feedback on the film as I truly want to see what people think of it and I want to really nurture my skills as a filmmaker. Thanks!

Filmmakers,When collaboration becomes passivity,"Hello, fellow filmmakers

I am working as camera operator in a short film that the director basically only delas with the ectors and does some coordination on set. No significant notes to the cinematographer or the art director. Basically the cinematographer and the production designer do whatever they want and the director only gives a couple notes and tells where the camera should be and even that is Very general and kind of useless because i am gonna end up doing what the dp tells me regardless of being what the director said.

Even when we do something completely different from what the director told, he Just lets It go.

His Focus is mostly in the actors and even there he gives the actors a lot of freedom and doesnt even bloco them without their opinion. Sometimes the actors will block themselves and the only thing the director does in those cases is to communicate other people what the actors have decided.

I want to be a director myself, so i observe a Lot How directors usually work and this guy comes out as just passive and uninspired.

So now my question:

Is there a point in which a director can be too collaborative and become passive?"

Filmmakers,Is Film school a good option considering covid + location (UK),"Hello everybody, I was wondering if I should go to film school instead of just looking for jobs, I know there are plenty of posts about whether someone should go or not, but they all seem very American-centric or never seem to explicitly consider the impacts of covid on the industry in terms of getting entry-level jobs in the UK either. So I'd like some opinions on whether I should still study film at uni taking all this into consideration, currently, I'm definitely considering going.

Many people often say you don't need film school, it's a waste of money and to just look for jobs but I feel like this doesn't take into account how covid 19 has affected the industry, as it's super hard right now to get an entry-level job as a runner, especially as I've been trying for a few months to get some paid and unpaid jobs now that I've finished sixth form with no replies back ( I know this is normal, but it puts it into perspective- it's not going to be easy and I have no prior set experience either) Furthermore, I'm in the UK where it is nowhere near as expensive to go to a university to study, and student debt isn't as aggressive and immediate (you only need to pay back after you're making 27k a year, and it's less than £300 a month + it all gets cancelled after you hit 30 so you don't have to pay it back ). Also, while I know that I want to work in film, I'm not entirely sure what role, and I feel like University will be good for that. The course that I want to do will be a production one, and not studies/theory so will most likely get hands-on experience. In 2019, I wanted to do an apprenticeship in film or just jump straight into the industry, but most applications are closed for apprenticeships (there are also a lot less going around due to covid) and as I've said before the industry is even more competitive also thanks to covid.

Essentially, right now, university looks like the most stable option currently especially due to covid and it's not really gonna land me in debt or anything either."

I'm looking into buying a new camera, and have big doubts about what to buy, so I could really use some opinions on this.

My current choice stands between the Lumix S5, Bmpcc 6k pro and Lumix Gh5.  
I mostly do documentary work, both run and gun and on tripod, and I travel for work so would prefer a fairly easy setup. I currently have two EF lenses(one with IS), and would prefer to get a camera compatible with them or with a speedbooster, but to still stay on my budget at around 2300$.

Any experiences with the cameras mentioned for my type of field?

I've been recommended the 6k pro in the stores but I worry it will be too expensive with the extra gear in the end, plus too heavy for my use.

Lately it seems like the word 'movie' gets used when someone is actually referring to a 'series' (episodic, tv show, etc). It's used so interchangeably and so frequently that I'm starting to reassociate words in my own brain that were previously exclusive to movies/films/theatrical releases. Words like 'filmic', 'filmmaking'... I don't even know if there is an equivalent term when it comes to series.

Filmmakers,Location Sound Question,"Hi everyone! I'm working on a short film shoot and visited our location today - it's an older building beside a busy street, and the sound of passing cars carries in quite clearly when it's raining and the road has become wet.

Changing locations doesn't seem feasible at the moment due to needing a very specific medical setting and current COVID-19 restrictions in my area. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to dampen the outside street sounds as much as possible on set, or any insight as to how much of that background sound will be captured using a supercardioid mic or lavs/how bad the sound would be? Or alternatively, how difficult it is to clean up car sounds in post? Basically any advice or insight would be hugely appreciated! Thanks in advance!"
Filmmakers,"Paid $35000 to help a friend fund his film, now they need more money?","Disclaimer, I'm not artistic at all. 2 years ago my friend came to me with what they called an investment opportunity. I had recently come into an inheritance of $30,000. My friend, let's call them John, had an idea for a film and asked me if I would fund it. I don't have an artistic bone in my body, but I had an ex who was an actress and it was super cool the few times I was on set with her. I had seen some of John's stuff and he apparently had won some film festivals, and you always hear about movies being made for peanuts selling for millions of dollars. His idea sounded cool, so I told him I would fund his movie.

&amp;#x200B;

They filmed for about 2 weeks, I work full time, but I was able to drive down to see them film one weekend to check it out. I had only been on 2 other film shoots before, but it felt like the ""vibe"" was off, everyone seem really agitated and angry at each other. Occasional yelling arguments, which I had never really seen. I stayed out of the way and ran a few errands to help out, but it didn't seem like people were having a good time.

&amp;#x200B;

I was excited to see the final movie but John told me it would be several months until they had anything to show. I was disappointed, but said ok. It was almost a year later, right before Covid, we he came over and showed me what he had. My heart almost immediately sank. Again, I'm sure it's better than anything I could do, but it looked super amateurish. I don't want to be mean, but it almost seemed like a Saturday Night Live skit. It's a Science Fiction film, but I'm not a stranger to smaller scifi films (Primer is one of my all time favorites). The sound was awful. A lot of shots you could barely understand what actors were saying and there was this buzzing in a lot of it. Also the acting wasn't particularly good and the story didn't make a lot of sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not very assertive, but I did ask about the sound and tried to nicely ask if the special effects were done. He said that's why he's at my place, that they need at least another $5000 for sound, music and final changes. I'm not entirely sure why, but I said I yes. I thought otherwise it was basically unwatchable.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't hear much from him during Covid, but a few weeks ago he emailed me and told me they would need another $5000 for ""Additional VFX, color grading, etc"". Color grading is so it looks good and consistent? I'm not entirely sure what that is. Is that normal and a normal cost?

&amp;#x200B;

I asked to see the film as is, but he hasn't responded. I don't think he's just taking my money since he'll post on Instagram and Facebook about working on it. I'm also at a point I'm not sure it's worth pumping more money into. In the beginning I didn't think we'd become rich and famous, but I was at least hoping to help my friend and make my money back plus a few thousand. If I give him more money it'd be 40k, that's like a house down payment.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure why I'm posting, maybe just to vent. Does any of this sound normal? Is it normal to think a movie is bad that you helped make? Should I tell him the issues I have with it? Is that even my place? I feel like I'm never going to see any fraction of that money again. I just don't know if it's fixable with the things he now wants. It just feels like a money pit now.

Just looking for advice.

Thankfully I do better than most and last year was surprisingly good money wise, but $40000 is a lot of money whoever you are.

Edit: I have lived a very fortunate life and the inheritance was completely unexpected, from a relative I hadn't seen in decades. I don't mind spending $40,000 to help a friend, but I do mind wasting $40,000, if that makes sense.

Edit 2: Wow this is all overwhelming. A lot of people here have said some things I need to consider. I emailed him this afternoon firmly asking for a copy of the movie as is and all receipts. A small part of me HAS been worried about him not spending it all on the movie, I thought I was just being a bad friend thinking that. On Monday I'm going to contact my family's attorney, we did have some contracts in place, but I don't know the specifics, the attorney handled it all. I tried to make it as easy as possible for my friend and I wasn't remotely involved as I should have been or usually am with this type of stuff. "

I've watched a couple of videos comparing some gimbals with the glidecam/stedicam, but most of which I have seen are in the premise of a smaller sized cameras, as most gimbals dont allow for larger cinema cameras unless you go big. The newer gimbals actually allow for cameras up to about 14lbs. My camera is the C100 mkII. I've got the money for either one of these options, but i'm not quite sure which to get. I want to do some more narrative work, but I am currently just by myself shooting my own stuff to improve skills. 

Would it be better for me to get a gimbal if I am primarily just shooting on my own, or would the glidecam be a better investment? I love that the gimbal gives you the ability to have focus pull/zoom. But I am also a bit concerned with just tech failure, and also the more robotic look vrs the more natural look of the glidecam. Does anyone happen to have experience with both? which do you prefer?"

I'd like to know what my options are for achieving a look like this on video. Most of what I see with haze machines involve controlled interior sets, or different use cases. Most fog machine examples are for low-lying fog. Assuming access to power, and wetting the cement for reflections and diffusion isn't a concern, how might I achieve a haze/fog like this?

Also, should I buy lighting equipment or can I get away with using what I have at home? If I should get some equipment, what are the most important pieces of equipment and do you have any cheap(ish) recommendations?

What about camera stabilization? Should I use a tripod, gimbal, or something else? (I know that these are used in different cases but which is more important to get if I can only get one first?)

Filmmakers,Networking outside of LA: the Indie market,"So I should start by saying that I am an actress with a lot of experience in film. Commercial product shoots, music videos, short films, features, etc. My best friend happens to be an incredibly talented director up and coming with aspirations mostly in the independent film market. Because competition in LA is so steep and limits creative freedom, she started her own production company with the idea that there should be a space where talented creatives can gather and really stretch their wings. Here’s my question/ article of discussion. For those of you that have typically done well in the indie market, what lasting connections have you made across the scope of filmmaking? Was it by chance? A casting call? Indie film festivals? I’m just curious! I’d love to hear about your experiences :) also thank you for having me here. I’m brand new to Reddit and as an additional note, can I change my username or is this what I’m stuck with? THANKS GUYS! 🤗❤️"

Filmmakers,Sony A7Rii Recording levels,"For the life of me I can't figure this one out. I've run into this issue with an A7Rii in the past, and can't remember if I figured it out then either.

Here's what I'm having trouble with. I'm trying to record video on the A7Rii with an external mic (VideoMic Pro by RODE), and the audio is great. EXCEPT, when I stop talking for more than a few seconds and then start talking again, the audio peaks really high, almost like there's a setting that's trying to keep all audio the same, so it's bringing audio recording up higher when there's less audio.

At first I thought it was the mic, but this mic doesn't do that on any other of my cameras, and I can't find a setting on the mic that would do that.

There are very few audio settings I can find on the A7Rii, so I'm at a loss as to what is causing this. Any guesses?"

Filmmakers,"As a young amateur film director/screenwriter aiming to enter the film industry, I want to ask some questions about what decisions I should make in order to make that possible.","Hey, I'm a 17 year old amateur ""filmmaker"", and I've been trying to prepare myself for a future as a film director and screenwriter for a few years now. Most of the time though, I was just kind of screwing around, and scrapping almost every project before I even started. So...I don't have a lot to show for myself.

Only just recently have I actually completed [my first project,](https://youtu.be/YnS-X7lhO_4) and I'm currently working on my second. As of now, I work on short animated films. I actually would prefer live-action, but I don't realistically have the means to do that, so I learned animation for now.  

But anyway, that isn't really the point right now. Even after a few years of trying to do whatever research I can, I still kinda'....don't know shit. Yeah, no other way of really putting it. I still have lots of questions on things related to college, making connections, negotiating with producers, how to actually pitch an idea...there's a lot I need to get off my chest here. 

I understand that there is no ""one-way"" to filmmaking, and that I won't find all of my answers on a Reddit thread. But I'm at least hoping to get a few vague ideas of what I should do. Even a bit of information could send me in the right direction.

**College Plans:** I know people on this sub constantly talk about how going to college for filmmaking is a waste of time, but I'm just not willing to take that risk. The world is a fast moving place, and the film industry is even faster. People without preparation or connections are left behind. And the way I see it, the only way I can get preparation and connections is through college. As of right now, getting into New York University is my main goal, since I hear it's great for young filmmakers. 

My current plans for college however are still a bit messy. I've been switching back and forth between two plans...

*Plan 1:* Take a major in filmmaking, and take a minor in a back-up career, such as business management.

*Plan 2:* Do the opposite. Major in business management, and take filmmaking as a minor. 

The reason I'm thinking of getting a degree in something like business management is because I have to admit, I need a realistic back-up plan in case filmmaking doesn't work out. And I feel that perhaps business management is a skill that extends to filmmaking, as it's an industry with a heavy business side to it. The question is which course do I take priority in...

On one hand, I feel that filmmaking should be the major, as it is the endgoal I want. But on the other, I feel that I need to take a safer major, like business management. I understand that in the end  only I can make this decision, but I do want some advice on this matter.

**Making Connections:** Getting into the film industry is pretty much entirely reliant on connections, that much I know. But how exactly do I make those connections? 

Yeah, college is a big way to make them, which is one of the major reasons I'm planning on going to college. Through college I could meet other students interested in film, and work on low-budget projects with them. But that's just a surface level idea of the matter. And unfortunately, that's all I know. I'm hoping somebody could give me a bit of a better understanding of how connections are made through college. 

And aside from college, how do I make connections going farther? How do I make connections that will actually push me closer to getting into the industry? Where would the opportunities to make these connections be, what would I have to do to better my chances? 

From what I know, which isn't much by the way, I've heard that going to film festivals and working as a Production Assistant are probably the best ways to make connections. 

I'm hoping somebody could elaborate more on how exactly I would make connections and find opportunities through these systems. Applying to a film festival and showing my work is one thing, and that's difficult as it is. But what initiatives am I meant to take in order to make some meaningful connections. 

Same with being a Production Assistant. Getting the job is one thing, but how exactly do I take advantage of the opportunity and make connections through this? 

**Entering The Industry:** I need to understand...how do I actually make my first professional film? How do I get the opportunity to pitch a script to a producer or studio, negotiate a budget, and get started on a proper professional project?

I assume this question is partially answered by the connections I would've hypothetically made in the last question. But even with that, I'm pretty sure there are still more steps that I would have to take to get to the whole professional filmmaking part of it all. 

So I need to know, how do I get to that point? Who do I talk to, and how do I get the chance to actually meet up with a real producer, and pitch my screenplay/idea? What would I have to do or say to convince them of my project? How do I negotiate so that I don't potentially get screwed over in some shitty deal? 

And most importantly, how do I even get to the producer/studio's door to begin with? 

**Pitching An Idea:** So let's assume I actually got an opportunity to speak with a producer...how do I successfully pitch my script/idea? How do I convincingly sell them on the idea that their money would be well spent on my idea?

To be more specific, what kind of speaking styles and mannerisms would I use to make myself likeable to a producer, and to make my idea seem interesting?

I know people say ""talk fast"", but there's gotta' be more to it than that. I mean, I'm sure being quick and not wasting time is a good thing in a producer's eyes, but what else should I keep note of. 

Another thing is that I want to know how legitimate the whole ""talk fast"" advice is. Sometimes I hear stories of director/writers talking for a literal hour, and still succeeding in convincing the producer of their idea. I don't know how legitimate that is...but I want to know what people here have to say.

**Creative Control:** One of the issues I'm worried about is that even if I somehow get past every other problem and trial I've mentioned, there's still one big issue. And that's my ability as a director and screenwriter to maintain creative control over my projects. 

A lot of times, I hear about incidents where studios would interfere with the script, and make demands to change the story. And I want to try and avoid that to the best I can. Because at the end of the day, if I'm not getting to write and direct my stories the way I want, what's the point really?

I understand that sometimes I'll have to give in and change a few things to get the job. Sometimes studios will demand certain changes, and I'll have to put up with that. But what worries me is if ""change a few of these small things"" turns info ""change all of these major things"". Because at that point, it isn't even really my script anymore. 

Obviously this is a hypothetical issue, and I'd be lucky for this to be my only issue if I ever got into the industry. But still, I want to know, how can I maintain creative control over my projects?

From what I understand, it relates to budget. Smaller budget projects are given more creative freedom, as they aren't much of a risk to the studio's finances. Whereas larger budget projects tend to deal with heavy studio interference, in order to ensure a massive return on investment. 

So I guess the obvious answer would be to stick with small budgets. But is there anything more I should be aware of, in order to maintain creative control?

And if I am to work with smaller budgets, what kind of budgets should I expect? What exactly constitutes as ""low budget""? 

**TLDR:** Yeah...there's no easy way to put this all into a TLDR section. I mean, I've got a lot of questions, and questions within those questions. Like, a fuckton of questions. Hell, I'll probably end up making another post with more questions later. Starting to realize the irony in making such a long post in an industry all about talking fast...

Still, I had to ask these questions at some point. Even if I don't get perfectly exact answers here, hopefully I can get some advice here that might send me in the right direction. 

So, whatever advice you guys have got, I'll take it. Anything is helpful...I hope."

Filmmakers,What do we need to get started on making a film?,"Hey all, so we have made a few short films in the past, nothing too formal; just some friends that get together for a day to film something then I or my friend edit it together. However, we would like to make a full(er) length film this summer. We have equipment that we've gathered throughout the years, and have a script ready. We are just concerned about two things. We are going to be having a relatively large crew (\~15 members) with some of them being members of a partner organization, so not friends of ours and as such makes me stressed about many implications. Do we need to get insurance of any kind? Our budget is as low as it can possibly be. If we need to spend money we would have to scrape it up one way or another. Another thing is we would like to have a prop gun in the movie. Is this possible under our conditions? Could we use an unloaded airsoft gun as the prop (again, cost; one of our cast members has one, but if needed we can invest in an actual prop gun.)

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is through the partner, we will have a venue to premiere the film (not a theater, but an auditorium). We would like to collect ticket money to attend the premiere. The funds ideally would go in a 60/40 split with 60% going to some holding account for our production group and 40% being dispersed to cast and crew equally. Another thing mentioned was trying a GoFundMe, however I'm not quite sure that will pan out, that was mentioned internally but I'm not quite sure how far that will get. Would it be worth it to form some sort of entity for our group, something like an LLC or the sort? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd appreciate any pointers to get us started in the right direction, I'd hate to have to stop or scrap production because we didn't have anything in order. Thank you!!"
Filmmakers,Should I lie about our budget?,"My friends and I are finishing our first feature. We made it on a complete shoestring, the sort of thing that’s almost embarrassing. However we pulled in every favor, and have top-notch cinematography, lighting, and production. We talked a famous film editor into putting it together for us, and with his name attracted other high-end post people to make it look and sound top-shelf.

So here’s where my question comes in. Do we tell people what we made this for, and get laughed at, or say what this would have cost if everyone charged regular rates? Do we look better for having made something inexpensively, or will we be treated better in pitching our next film if we say this one was done for $x million dollars, and we can handle that sort of budget? Love your thoughts. Thanks!"

Filmmakers,Amateur question : why shoot in log if you cant see the grading?,"Im new to filmmaking and I have been looking around at how movies are shot, and I see they are using either log or arriraw.

So my question is how are filmmakers getting their pre-decided looks with a profile that is designed to not have a look?

edit: i was in a bit of a rush posting this so i will elaborate. I own a blackmagic pocket camera with the ability to overlay certain luts over the gen 5 raw footage. I did try to find more information online with one of them saying that raw is comparable to log (apologies if that statement made anyone cringe), and that the luts used in this camer are called baked-in luts. That might not be the case though since the lut usually doesnt effect the original raw image when it is imported into the computer."

Filmmakers,How can I set up my camera to take top down shots of me drawing?,"I am by no means a filmmaker but this subreddit seems to have great advice so I'm coming here!

I make drawing videos for my YouTube channel (art teacher who got bored/sad during lockdown last year, and now I have a lot of fun with it!) and I used my phone to record everything. I finally got myself a Canon M50 II for filming and I really like it so far, but in the tripod if I tilt it straight down the legs are still in shot. I'm not sure what kind of tripod I should be looking for instead that can help with top down shots. I got a tripod on Amazon for 39 dollars that I really like and is pretty sturdy (good enough for just filming in my house, anyway) but I can still return it for another kind if I need to. I'm not looking to spend hundreds, but if what I need to buy costs up to around 100 that's fine but I'd rather go cheaper if I can because at the moment I don't really need to tripod for anywhere other than inside my home so it doesn't need to be that heavy duty.

I'm looking for something inexpensive but will also work well -- as in, if it's something awkward I have to rig up and take down ever time, I'd rather pay a bit more to just have a piece of equipment meant specifically for what I need.

Also -- any suggestions on what to do to make my camera shots less shaky? Usually my shots are fine, but my house is super old and any time my cats run by, people upstairs walk, etc, my house shakes and then so does the camera. Not sure if there is something I can do to the tripod, or a setting on the camera, or even something in editing (I use premiere) that could help?

Thank you for any advice!"
Filmmakers,What does a tv director actually do?,"I’m wondering more about established shows, like a sitcom, or a show. Friends for example, David Schwimmer directed a few episodes. Or even Quentin Tarantino directed an episode of ER, and apart from an opening shot where three of the women walk wearing sunglasses, there wasn’t anything about it that distinguished it from other episodes. I can imagine there may be some shows where the director is making creative decisions, but so many shows are already established and in those cases what does the director have to do?

As an aside, it brings to mind that the director isn’t always an auteur, and doesn’t necessarily have to be the person getting all the credit, as is the standard system regarding films. And that a film is collaborative with many talented people who brought a lot to the table."
Filmmakers,Should I go to film school?,"I'm 16 and I really want to be a director when I'm older. In my community, it's just assumed that everyone will go to university or seek higher education. So that's what I had planned to do in a few years...I was really hoping I'd get into Ryerson University. But recently, my boyfriend shared with me how he wasn't going to college or university, and was instead seeking out an apprenticeship (he's going into the trades). I said that I thought that was a great idea for him and he would probably be better off. But that got me thinking, would it really make sense for me to go to film school? I've always justified it by saying that that's how I would make connections, learn new techniques, and having a degree would help me get more jobs in the future. But the thing is, school is really expensive. And a lot of people have said that anything you can learn at film school,  you can learn just as good off youtube. I figured this sub would be full of people who are actually in the industry, and could provide some useful advice. I want to make sure that whatever decision I make is a smart one."

Filmmakers,PA looking to transition to the Camera Team,"Hello everyone!

I’m a new PA based in Atlanta. I worked on a few commercials last year in LA but due to covid, I came back home to Atlanta. Since February, I worked on my first gig with Marvel as their staff walkie PA and I am currently on another big name film that happens to be a competitor to Marvel. 

During my time in school, I realized pretty quickly that cinematography is definitely what I want to do. Having worked with the AD department multiple times I also know that I don’t see myself ever being an AD and I don’t really enjoy the work within the department. I’m happy to do it for now, since I’m still new, but I’m looking to make the move into the camera department. 

I’ve made some great connections while on these projects, like camera ops, a camera PA, ACs, and even a few DPs - one of which was recently Oscar nominated.

Long story short, I want to make the move to the camera department as soon as I can. I’m just not really sure where to start. Some people tell me to just join the union and take their workshops. Others tell me to “simply” land a gig volunteering at a camera rental shop. Some even told me to keep PAing until a camera team decides to take me under their wing. I’m sure all of this is valid advice but I’m not really sure what to do.

I’m just looking for some guidance as to what I should be doing because I’m getting a lot of different opinions.

Filmmakers,"For goodness sake, write that movie idea down right now","I've been sitting on ideas for years, always thinking, yeah I'll get to that once I've got the right equipment, experience, contacts, etc. 

 Well 10 years ago when I was about 15 I began my obsession with Stephen King and his Dark Tower Multiverse. In subtle and not so subtle ways, The Dark Tower connects all his works together into an extended universe way before the Marvel Cinematic Universe came to screen. (Cinematic not Comic Book, for all I know Marvel was doing it way before Stephen King) 

The Dark Tower Universe and then Doctor Who gave me tons of ideas for a multiverse time travel adventures.  I even made a movie called ""Time Travel and Shit"" when I was 15 with a cheap knockoff camcorder i got for my birthday, it was about a time travelling hat which ends with the future protagonists hiding the hat for their past selves to find to continue the cycle. I deleted the whole thing after it was done in shame for how it turned out.

The sound of me pressing buttons on the cheap integrated mic where impossible to ignore, my actors where my teenage drama friends that dicked around the whole time, I had to edit one scene at a time on windows movie maker, save them as individual movies and then stitch together with severe quality loss because my computer couldn't handle it all at once.

Since then I've been obsessed with making sure I have the right camcorder, the right editing software, the right computer and on and on until I realized I haven't made a movie in years. That one bad experience of it not turning out the exact way I wanted in my head had stunted me for years and now I feel myself regretting all the time I've wasted just trying to wait and save money instead of putting my ideas out there. Over the years I've developed my stories and characters in my head, waiting for that perfect moment when I can fully realize it the way I want to.

Now I finally have my ingredients, a film quality camera, great computer, awesome editing software, ready to make my vision a reality ..and then Disney+ Loki comes out... 

No spoilers for those who haven't seen it but god fricken damn. Now I'm sure those plotlines and theories where written into the comics way before I was even born and there is a ton of multiverse fiction out there but now I'm so mad that its been put on screen in the mainstream before I could kick myself into gear (The TVA is what made me especially mad). 

I'm totally aware however that even if I did make my film ideas a reality before Marvel moved onto this next phase, I most probably wouldn't be famous still. My ideas might've been awful and totally nonsensical, just another indie sci fi movie in the wind. However I can't help but feel I've missed my chance to get my foot in the door on this next wave of MCU driven multiverse Sci fi without feeling derivative and a copy cat. I mean Twilight had its True Blood and Hunger Games had its Maze Runner/DieVirgint so there's always a chance you can ride the popularity wave but who really wants that legacy? (Jk I'd take the opportunity in a heart beat) 

I've rambled on a bit but my point is go and fricken write down that movie that's rattling round in your head, you can always edit it later, write it down before it's paraded before you in bright lights with non of your signature flair. Even if it comes to nothing, you'll be able to boast to your peers that you thought of it first with the written/produced/filmed evidence before you. As you can guess I'm obviously salty af but Im not mad at Marvel because of the sheER SEXUAL THRILL I get from being a casual fan.

 I'd give anything to see my ""Time Travel and Shit"" movie again, just so I could see and maybe feel  again the drive and motivation too make something like that, back then it felt bigger than myself. Wasn't worried about camera quality, sound quality, software, processing power etc. I just wanted to make a movie and I did it with what I had.

I should have been proud of myself but instead I was disgusted that it didn't look like a hollywood quality film straight away with my 0 experience at 15 yrs old. Afterword everyone involved was asking to see it and I lied saying my computer fucked up and lost all the footage. I started a new channel a year or two after and made short funny sketches which was getting popular but then I deleted it one day after feeling like I was just being cringy. Then every few weeks for years, people where asking for the links to my videos and I had to tell them they didn't exist anymore. 

Please please please just do something right now, even just something small like writing it down, even if you're feeling like its not worth it, every idea is gold when filmed through the right lens. I've been mainly talking about myself through this whole post but if anyone else is feelin anxious to get back into filming gimme a message and maybe we can collab and get something going?"

Filmmakers,Help a newbie with sound issue (Røde Video micro),"Hello everyone, 

I am very new to this so I hope my question won't be too obvious

I use to travel a lot and I though it would be a good idea to share my trips at least with my family and my friends.

To do so I bought a gimbal and a mic (Røde Video micro).

So I did some tests with the native camera of my phone and I have noticed something pretty anoying.

When I put the mic on its support and I move, I can hear crackles in the sound, the more I move the more I have. The mic holder is the one supplied when purchasing the mic

However, when I take the mic with my hand, the crackles just seem to disapears.

Did it happen to someone here too ? Does anyone know if the crackles are normal ? 

I would be very glad to have advice 😊"

Filmmakers,I regret not going to film school and I worry I've left things too late,"I've always been passionate and obsessive about films and making them. From as young as 8 or 9 I made stop motion animations, music videos, wrote doctor who scripts, and built my own film props. Throughout high school I made short films with my friends and I got very high grades in my film classes. My film tutors were certain I'd have a media role because I seemed like a natural and I was always 100% certain I'd go to university to study film.

Well, that's not what happened. I freaked out and worried I wouldn't be able to do anything, so I did a law degree instead. What did I do after that? Got a masters in human rights law. Now that doesn't sound like something to be too upset about, it can't hurt to have a couple of law degrees under my belt, but I feel like I've betrayed my passion.

I've gone back to the idea of film making in a big way. I've been writing scripts throughout uni, and I've used my uni library pass to ransack the film department of all their film theory and screenwriting textbooks. I've been on my local film maker page and I've signed up to any local project as any role, runner, gaffer, etc, pretty much all unpaid.

I'm 24 now, and yes, still relatively young. But I feel like I've wasted what could have been a very productive period and opportunity to go to film school and make connections. Now I don't know how to find a way in. I barely have enough money to pay for any equipment because I have rent to pay and I work part time whilst I study. I'm just reading academic textbooks about film production and, unlike my law textbooks, I find them to be absolute page turners!

Anyone else here not go to film school but still managed to get into film whether that be as a career or a serious hobby? What steps did you take?"

Filmmakers,Non commercial short film: Copyright questions regarding brand images and sounds,"Hello, 

I hope this is the right forum for this. It is my first short film production and I am not sure regarding the question of copyright with the use of images and sounds. 

For our short film, which we plan to submit to festivals and afterwards publish online for free, we are planing to use certain elements for which we don't have the copyrights:

1. The sound of 'Message send' used by iPhones
2. The design and brand of 'Tinder' (pictured and mentioned in conversation) 
3. We show messages and emojis designed after 'WhatsApp'

Perhaps someone has encountered a similar problem and can help me with those questions:

1. Could there be a problem for us regarding copyright violations, if we use the things mentioned above without contacting the copyright owners? 
2. Does the fact, that some Festivals could provide prize money be a problem since the short film could be seen as a commercial production? 
3. Are there some tricks or grey areas we can use like using the Tinder design, but call it by a similar name? 

Hope this is the right forum for the problem? 

Thank you for helping us out :)"

So I've been using Sony Vegas Pro for YEARS (now rebranded as Magix). There are many editors now, some 11 years later, that seem to mimick a lot of the features I became comfortable with. However I'm having some trouble with the following:

I'm wanting to add motion tracked 3D objects in post-production. Things like royalty-free objects and whatnot - nothing realistic looking at all. Any suggestions for achieving this?

* Is there a program that does this with ease that can make a clip to edit into a project?
* Is there a reputable place to get 3D objects?

Filmmakers,Is Mandy.com worth it?,"Hey everyone. I'm a semi-professional filmmaker, entering my final year in college, where I'll get a BA in Film Production. I already have an AA. If it's relevant, it's not a ""film school"", it's a state University that has a film program. I didn't want to graduate and be right at square one like a lot of film majors are, so I've been working on films for years (including during my time in community College) so that when I get my BA I also have a body of work to show everyone. So far I've been able to acquire about 20 credits (as an actor) and about 23 as a crew member. I'm definitely the type of person who would rather be working on something, even if it's not a film that I'm directing and I'm just a crew member, or working in a role that isn't my preference, than not working on any films at all. I view working on films in any capacity to be worth the experience. The media company I work for doesn't have a lot of projects on its plate right now so I'm looking for experience elsewhere. This is also the first time in my life where I have a car and a license, which I've been using liberally, because I love driving. Being located in Northern California is a big plus, since San Francisco, which is a major production hub, is about 2 hours away. I came across Mandy.com and while it seems legitimate, I'm always wary of any service that requires you to pay to be on their site. Mandy doesn't do that, but you are required to pay to apply to any of the jobs posted there. Does anyone here have experience using Mandy? Is it worth the price? What % of your jobs come from mandy.com? Can anyone speak on this? Thanks in advance"

Filmmakers,Did I make the right choice? (Direct sound recording in-set),"So, we're shooting a student film with very limited budget and also where the cast are little kids (5 - 10 years old). I am in charge of recording the direct sound and for some, if not the majority of the shots the director has had to directly speak to the children, essentially ruining my takes.

Luckily, this isn't a dialogue-heavy short (pure voice-over and one or two shots with dialogue), so I've opted for not pressuring the crew into staying silent during takes so that they can get the best performance out of these children. This means I'm not recording any sound for the majority of takes. I'm only doing it for scenes with dialogue or when the crew isn't instructing the children. The director is very worried about this and to calm him I've told him that we can make foleys work out in this short. After all, the vast majority of sound in this short are steps, doors, etc.

However, I have never done any foley work in my life so I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared myself. Did I make the right choice? Again, I'm trying to get the dialogues as clean as possible (my equipment is shit so there is a bit of noise in the dialogue anyway) but there's this lingering thought in my mind that I have screwed the sound and the whole short for my team. :("
Filmmakers,Decision to make.,"I know you guys have seen a million of these posts in the past, but this one is mine. First of all, hello!

So, at the end of this month I'm moving. I've done a lot of PA work, have a decent resume, and saved money for the past year in anticipation of this move. I have a little under $5K saved. Just like millions of other dreamers, I want to write and direct. Making movies is my favorite thing in the world, it's genuinely the only thing I've ever been passionate about. 

For the past year my goal was to move to Atlanta, work there until I've built up enough of a reputation/experience in the camera department, then move to LA. However, recently I had a talk with a close friend who told me that if I'm already going all in on myself like this, I might as well just go to LA. Especially considering that the work there is higher paying, I'd meet the people I want to meet, and its where I eventually want to end up. The biggest downside I see is the cost of living. I'm seeing shared rooms for around 900 a month. 

In Atlanta, the cost of living is lower, but they also pay less and don't hire above the line. (Plus I hate the humidity, but I'm willing to look past that.)

What do you suggest? Is there anything I should know before making the move? And wherever I move, where should I look for housing? I've mostly been checking Facebook marketplace.

Thanks!"

\- Fully fleshing out characters

\- Music directing and outsourcing (a little cinematography direction)

\- Currently working in Casting and like the executive decision responsibilities as opposed to my past creative roles

Most improvement seen:

\- Fitting everything in the allotted time

\- Translating page to screen 

\- Coordinating the consulting process

I want to stay away from getting him any gear unless it’s something he could definitely use
1) because I’m poor :( and
2) I don’t know exactly what he needs or has and it seems like the kinda thing he likes to upgrade slowly by himself if that makes sense.

So is there anything I could get to go with his camera or do any of you have any other ideas?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcwGleN38zE&amp;t=378s

There are multiple people with go-pros attached to their chest (although seemingly usage of this footage is scarce)

They are all in different locations

They are all holding hand-held cameras 

There are camera operators also following the 'main' subjects who also have the same hand-held/go-pro set up

My understanding is that go-pros don't generally seem to last for more than an hour or two filming and it doesn't seem like people are recording CONTINUOUSLY with the hand-helds so obviously people are on and off recording. 

How would then the editor go about syncing this footage chronologically? 

Is there some feature of go-pros that give you time stamps you can remove in post?

Would you give up 'syncing' traditional multi-camera time-lines and just look for the footage when it seems necessary from the 'main' camera operators.

Is it more likely to be editing trickery and a lot of the footage is used out of sync?

I know no-one knows the editor does for sure but how would one tackle a filming situation such as this."

I know there is a word for this type of special effect, but the way so many movies have referred to this thing as ""the glow"" makes me wonder if it had any kind of cultural significance. I have come to reddit to ask 1.8 million film enthusiasts, what was the importance of ""the glow"" back in the day? 70s to early 90s give or take."

Filmmakers,video recording on VHS camera,"not sure if anyone knows anything about this specific camera but I have some general questions! I just bought a Panasonic handheld camcorder PV-L680D online and I dont have the slightest clue on how to use it properly.

 my first question is can you film something and then stop the recording, but then pick up the camera again later on and record a different setting using the same tape? or do you have to use the full tape up on one recording. 

Another question I have is, is there anyway you can transfer the VHS tape footage to your computer at home without it being costly? id rather not go through a store to develop it for me. 

my last question is, is there a lot of editing that needs to be done to the actual video when it is successfully on the computer? the reason I decided to buy this camera was so I could get vintage looking footage, I dont care about amazing quality, but I see everyone on these threads talking about editing the footage afterwards, is it necessary?

Filmmakers,DIY Grid Light modifier?,"**TL;DR: I'm specifically looking for any obscure piece of hardware that has the same shape as a grid/honeycomb that I can just clamp onto a gobo arm in front of a fixture like a diffuser or filter.**

I bought a 42 inch parabolic softbox meant for photography because I liked how shallow it was (allowing me to place it in more compact spaces) and how it collapses, however Selens (the manufacturer) doesn't make a honeycomb modifier for the 42 inch.

I love the softbox, and it lets me fill a whole room with a powerful point-source, but I might one day want to use it on a subject, and need to isolate the subject from the background. In this scenario, a grid/honeycomb modifier would be great. I am of course open to just buying another softbox, but if I can save a quick buck, I would like to.

I've looked into many DIY grid/honeycomb methods, but I'd rather not have to ""put something together"". If there's some weird piece of hardware that I can get at a home depot or hobby store or something, that I could simply clamp to a gobo arm and get the same results, that would be preferable.

Does this exist--or am I just a dreamer?

There's some kind of plot throughout which maybe has to do with a lover but then the character realizes something is wrong and it turns out they've been dead for years or something.

Filmmakers,"Newbie Filmmaker, questions about first short","I am trying to take the (exciting/scary/maybe ill-advised) plunge into making my first real short film. I've finished my first script thanks to a local screenwriting course I've taken that's been really helpful. It's come in at around 13 pages, which feels like a decent duration for a first project. The leap from script to production though is pretty daunting, especially because I don't have any industry contacts. I'm stubborn, though, and I want to dive in if I can.

&amp;#x200B;

Some details about the short:

Script length: 13 pages, Expected Duration: \~10-15 minutes

Primarily following a single actor in the woods, with a mix of day and night scenes

Fairly static shots except for one running scene

Some planned VFX (black fog, eerie glows) but these would not be deal breakers

Minimal dialog

&amp;#x200B;

1) Can I even direct?

I come from the video game industry so I am very familiar with budgeting, pre-production, and probably some skill overlap with post-production, but I don't have much on-set technical experience with audio or camera work. The last time I acted was in 2nd grade and it was one line (though my mom said I was quite good). In other words, I've got a relatively concrete idea in my head (shots, tone, etc) but I may be out of my element on set from a skills perspective. Am I still realistically able to direct this as long as I lean on the crew's technical experience? Put it another way - will I be taken seriously or will it be awkward for everyone? 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Would it be reasonable to hire a crew or a production company for a first short?

I'd like to get hands on experience with this project and I imagine I'd learn a lot very quickly by working with people who are experienced with this. I've received some advice that I should just do this with friends to start so I don't ""waste money on what will probably be a rough first project"", but I'm a little concerned that I'll either learn more slowly or learn bad habits.

&amp;#x200B;

3) What would a reasonable, minimal production crew be for this?

With the digging I've done, I've basically come to: DP, gaffer/grip, sound. Would I need an AC? Should I try to get by without the sound mixer because there's minimal dialog? Am I just way, way off?

&amp;#x200B;

4) Related to above - Is $10k a realistic budget for a \~10-15 minute short with experienced crew?

I would guess about a 3 day shoot from what I've read and from the relative simplicity of the scenes, though I may be vastly underestimating something (like the complexity of lighting a forest at night).

I'm less concerned about gear except where it's critical (e.g. low-light camera and portable lighting system) and would rather that budget go towards skilled people.

It's still a lot of money, especially for something I know won't make any money back, but I want to learn and I want a portfolio piece that I can call my own.

displays.

\* **PQ Optimized:** Delivers the optimized HDR performance of this

display.

\* **PQ 600:** Preserves PQ curve till displaying maximum luminance

Filmmakers,Asus ProArt PA329C problems,"So, I bought Asus PA329C monitor for video editing and to watch movies as well.

It is generally a good monitor, but I found these issues:

1- The green is dominant, even after windows calibration I feel the green tint is still all over the place (see the picture)

2- HDR mode is even greener, MUCH greener, and when it is on that mode, you can't control much else, it is like a package that you've to take it or leave it, so I left it (also because it gets VERY hot)

3- During the first weeks after buying it, I had three incidents where the monitor will freeze with a random color showing up (e.g. specific shades of red or green or blue). That stopped happening for several months now, but it still worries me.

I turn 30 this year so I'd like the finished product to be my treat to myself. I'm familiar and comfortable with the video editing and sound mixing aspects, but I have never done a project that required lighting and this lighting is *specific.* Again, this is just a fun little hobby-type project so I am on somewhat of a budget, as I may or may not have need for this equipment again in the near future. 

If you haven't seen the special I'll do my best to describe what I'm looking to accomplish. 

4 light sources:

* One is a small LED panel (about the size of a smartphone) that he holds in his hand and uses as a ""flash"" accent that silhouettes him against the room. This one I'm sure I can find something to make it work.
* 2 full color spectrum spotlights on stands to the left and right of the main subject, angled to center. They have to be bright enough to cast a shadow on the walls behind me. The color is pink with a bluish tinge around the upper edges/corona, and I'm not sure how he created that effect.
   * An additional light (same kind) centered on the floor, angled upwards, with the same color effect (when all 3 are on, there are 3 visible shadows on the ceiling/walls behind and beside him)
* \*\*\*\*The 3 pink/blue spotlights are controlled by 3 foot pedals to turn them on/off in time with the beat of the song. 

Like I said I've never used stage lighting for anything I've filmed so I don't even know where to begin to start searching, or how to set them up to be controlled by foot pedals. Any links, tips, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Again it's just a goofy ""for fun"" project that I can send to my friends and family on my 30th birthday this year, so frugality is a plus. Thanks in advance!"

I have a car so I can pick you up and also know how to edit videos (although if you could edit too that would be awesome) so I’m mainly looking for a partner that wants to just get out there and film together. My days are open for this sole purpose! 

**What is the pay?**

I quit my job and am putting my life into this, it's sink or swim for me, so I'm looking for a partner that is equally committed to the vision. With this partnership, we can figure out how to spit any of the earnings that follow.

Not only is it much easier to film with a partner but I have missed out on recording some awesome spontaneous conversations that would have made amazing content because I was so wrapped up in the conversation there was no way I could have pulled out my camera and filmed it.

Take a look at my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/shnarbis/) to see if our personalities would be a good fit, cuz that will have a big impact in how we capture these experiences and brainstorm new video ideas together."
Filmmakers,Question about shot list - do yall indicate position of camera relative to actor or do you let your storyboard/floor plan do the talking?,"What I mean is, do you guys specifically state on your shot list if the camera will be behind, in front, to the side of your actors, or do you just indicate the shot type and angle and so on and show the particular position on your floor plans and or storyboards? 

Just curious to know how everyone does it."
Filmmakers,What is a good manageable length for a first short film?,"I'm a screenwriter looking to produce/direct my own work and I've come to the realization that I have been too ambitious with my plans for my first film and have been writing shorts that will require skills I simply don't have. 

Initially I had planned to do a 10-15 minute short but I don't want to spend that much time on something that I will never show to people. 

Assuming it will take me a few projects at least to make anything I'm willing to show, what is a good length to write? 1-2 minutes? 5 minutes? 

Where do they start you in film school? 

Thanks in advance!"

Filmmakers,"Question about pay rates as a beginner in the industry, being paid under the minimum wage where I live","So far, all of the work I've been doing has been free/voluntary where I've just been focused on making good connections. Now, I have come across an offer that could be my first paid gig. 

It's offering $100/day over the span of 8 days for the gaffer position. Doing the math, if the days are as short as 8 hours (which they won't be), I'd be making $12/hr.

The minimum wage for where I live is $15/hr. Should I just take the job and be happy I'm finally getting paid for something? Or is this just taking advantage of people in my position with a similar state of mind of ""Finally! Money!"" that I shouldn't succumb to?

Filmmakers,Kicked from a tv show INSANE STORY,"So basically i was working with this guy who went by 138 productions. Everything went smoothly. I got sick film dates got moved. Scheduling was hectic. For the record i run a lumix g85 on a ronin sc pro with a rode ntg4 and zoom h4n pro as my full setup. With a boom pole of course. Anyways. So they wanted me to sign an NDA, video release form, couple others they said theyd get to me. Instead, about 2 weeks later after i bought new grips batteries a new lens AND nd filters just for this show, they removed me out of nowhere. They tried to terminate contracts they had with me but couldnt. They refused to meet with me even before they removed me for some reason so i never could hand them papers cause my scanner is broken. They tried to still enforce their NDA on me but they had no paperwork on me. And they have the batteries i need for my own personal project which is also going badly atm. Im a lone filmmaker with no help atm. Doing it all alone. And i still dont have my property i paid for. Anyways. What hurts is that i missed out alot of work and invested time and money into this project. Even got 2 adobe certs in the same day. They just boot me. They said they hired me cause they wanted a mind like mine blah blah blah.This is not a smear, so feel free to watch the show. It is a pretty solid script. It just sucks how they played me. I feel really upset. Im young, crazy passionate, and was pretty dedicated to the project."

My former laptop died on me so I'm looking for a new one.

I have a main desktop computer but I need a good laptop for backing up the files from my Lumix GH5 and editing some short videos while on travel (documentaries, video reports), and other multimedia / creative tasks (photoshop, lightroom, indesign). I commonly use Adobe Premiere for video editing, as DV Resolve is nearly impossible to run on a laptop as far as I tried.

Filmmakers,Question Regarding Credits (?),"Upon completion of my short film, the director of photography, whose a bit of a prima donna, has decided he would like his name removed from the project. I truly believe it’s his loss, but I’m not one to beg people to stay.

Filmmakers,Looking for some ideas/suggestions/feedback for my work in progress,"Hey everyone, I hope you all had a nice, relaxing and enjoyable weekend. Anyway, I’m in the beginning stages/process of writing a low/no budget, contained type stalker thriller with limited characters. Reason being is I’m actually hoping to film this myself. But I’m stuck on ideas, at least on ones that haven’t been seen before in these types of films. Would anyone be willing to give me some ideas/suggestions/feedback for my work in progress? Here’s where I’m at with my story/idea right now…

The story begins with Caleb and his boyfriend Josh, who are at home watching a movie in the living room one night. However, Josh keeps dozing off, while Caleb seems to be paying more attention to his phone. Caleb is scrolling through Facebook when he gets a random message from a guy named Lucas. They briefly start chatting when Josh complains about Caleb paying more attention to his phone than the movie. Caleb then quickly snaps back and complains about Josh falling asleep. Josh sarcastically apologizes for being tired, considering he’s the only one with a job at the moment. He then tells Caleb goodnight and storms off to the bedroom. Annoyed and upset with Josh, Caleb decides to continue his conversation with Lucas. They quickly begin flirting and Lucas ultimately ends up asking Caleb to meet up. However, Caleb suddenly feels guilty and ends up ignoring Lucas before joining Josh in bed.

The next morning, Caleb wakes up after Josh has already left for work, and finds an apology note from Josh from their argument the night before. Caleb then gets online and starts applying for more jobs. He gets another message from Lucas, but chooses to ignore it. After applying for jobs, Caleb cleans up around the house, then goes outside to mow. After mowing, Caleb hops in the pool to cool off when Lucas messages him again. Caleb ignores it yet again, but also senses that he is being watched. Later that evening, Caleb is preparing dinner when he gets a text from Josh, telling Caleb he has to work late. Josh apologizes and tells Caleb he doesn’t have to wait up for him. Caleb suddenly feels defeated when all of a sudden, he once again gets another message from Lucas, asking Caleb if he’s ignoring him now. Feeling lonely and upset about Josh, Caleb finally decides to message Lucas back, seeing a potential opportunity to hook up with him. They exchange Snapchats and quickly begin flirting. However, their flirtatious snaps quickly take a dark turn when Lucas starts sending Caleb snaps as he gets closer and closer to his address, even before Caleb gives it to him. This quickly sends a red flag to Caleb and Caleb tells Lucas to leave him alone. However, Lucas sends Caleb one more snap, seemingly from across the street from his house. Caleb nervously swings open the door and is startled to see Josh, who has just arrived home. Josh questions Caleb about his frantic/nervous behavior and Caleb questions back by asking Josh why he told him he was working late. Josh tells Caleb he wanted to surprise him to make up for their argument. 

Over the next few days, Lucas continues to stalk/harass Caleb, while Caleb tries to keep Lucas and his increasingly threatening behavior a secret from Josh. 

Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions/feedback for me? I would greatly appreciate it, as I’m kind of finding myself stuck at the moment."
Filmmakers,"Looking for a part, and because production gear is exceedingly dumb about standards, finding the name has been interesting.","I'm looking for this part, but in a specific set of radii. I need it in a 1.35 to 1.5 inch diameter. I've seen sites call it a stand collar, or a telescoping collar, but if you search those terms, you get a whole lot of bupkiss, and even worse, almost none of them list their diameters, and the few who do are all replacements for stands that aren't worth repairing.  


I recently obtained a very sturdy beefcake of a stand(It's designed for wig styling and repair. but I've got other uses for it, given its ridiculously over-constructed build quality) second hand, and while the posts themselves are what can charitably be described as overkill(Seriously, I'm pretty sure these things are the same pipes they use for 10x20 carport tents), the fittings are all the absolute cheapest plastic they could possibly be. Which means that this collar piece has gotten shredded by the bolt holding the retaining nut in(So it no longer tightens OR loosens, staying in a permanent limbo of useless).  


As a side note, if anyone's got the name of the part that holds the legs to the central core stand(the hinge point of each of those three legs as it folds), that'd be awesome too. The legs are also 1.35 inch diameter, so the center core hinge piece would have to support a 1.5 inch central core, and three 1.35 inch legs. Sources would also be appreciated, because I'd hate to bin this thing when it's frankly rock-solid, other than these pisspoor fittings.

Filmmakers,"If Cinema were to be added as a class in the school curriculum, what movies would it included and why?","What movies should be included and what would the lesson be about? Historical, film making techniques, political , artsy, symbolism story telling, etc. 

The following is what lead me to come up with this question

Last year at the start of the pandemic, I noticed that a lot of my friends didn’t hold cinema as something that could be political, or an art form, or a way to do social commenting. They saw it purely as entrainment. Their movie mileage has been huge blockbuster films and that’s it. Mainly big franchise movies like super heroes and Fast and furious. Some hadn’t even seen a Tarantino film. 

This lead me to shown them the other side of movies. The slow dramas, the beautiful cinematography, the independent movies, genre bending etc etc. Movies that are Oscar worthy, though I dislike the oscars so mainly film festival worthy. Like Venize or Cannes. So during the first couple months of lock down last year I forced to watch a wide variety of movies as if we were having literature but with movies."

Do you guys know of any more professional options that still give me that freedom of movement, but also give me better lighting results , all of this witoutch being very big?

Filmmakers,Social Media and the industry,"A few days ago there was a thread about how to get work in Ontario and all the answers were....Use Facebook.

I produce a lot of content, most of the crew I don't know I find through Facebook groups, Put out a call, people submit. Check to see if we have mutuals and get a reference from one of those people and then hire someone.

The film industry has always been a social industry, the old saying ""Its not what you know, its who you know"" does not apply to knowing someone famous, its that 99% of your work come from social connections and word of mouth. 

The modern platform for that IS facebook and other social media. They are invaluable for getting consistent work in the industry or at least getting your foot in the door. Have a picture of yourself on there and join these groups, it is a gateway to the industry. Ours is a weird one where the paid platforms and Linkedin are not really used for crew.

I know two of the biggest hiring groups are ""I need a Fixer/Producer/Crew"" there's an American and Canadian version (I mod the Canadian one so shameless plug)

But seriously I know Facebook is a monster, and most other social media have a long list of reasons to avoid. But they are incredibly useful to furthering your careers and breaking in. Ive seen many people try and start up websites for film hiring and many people fail or spend lots of money, only for no one to use them."

Filmmakers,Looking for really cheap camera for the sake of practicing,"Hey everyone,

I just recently got into recording. I've been doing some live streams and such for work and got a basic understanding of all the technical stuff. I never really had the opportunity to practice moving cameras around by hand while recording and actually trying to achieve certain moods or narratives by my recording setup though.

Since I am really broke right now but could very well use some recording skills in my professional life, I'd like to buy a really cheap camera that allows me to practice the very basics. I'm fine with a rather ""low quality"" thingy since the quality of the actual video is not as important as the possibility to make some basic experience in filming techniques, camera movement and such. So I think what would be important is a rather large width of field of view, I do not really know if there's in general (disregarding noise) a difference in field of view/distortion when compensating low size sensors with wider lenses? Also interchangible lenses seem to be kind of a must-have for what I'm actually trying to learn. (Even though I'm fine starting off with a single one).

I've read the FAQ-Thread but 600€ for the Panasonic Lumix is about two to three times my budget.  Is there some cheap low budget stuff that you could recommend?"

I shoot a combination of drama/ music vids, corporate, and doco. All ultra low budget and super fast paced shoots (I often don't have time to swing a lens, and taking ND filters on and off can be cumbersome).

I looked at used Sony fs7, but they are pretty big and heavy (I have bilateral tendonitis in my wrists).

Can't afford an fx6 etc.

The zcams seem like a good fit. I imagine shooting exclusively in proress.

Is there a big difference between the m4 and s6? Especially with rolling shutter, reliability etc?

Would love to hear some experiences.

I was rendering a 20 minute video, the rendering time is long because the only one working is my CPU. I have my Windows updated as well as my drivers, my GPU works perfectly in other programs. I do not know what is happening ;-; 

It also worries me due to the temperature levels that my CPU can reach if it is the only one that works, so I prefer to leave everything to my GPU or at least part of the work

Filmmakers,Let’s take a minute and give a shoutout to all the hard working camera ops out there 👏 We appreciate you ❤️,
Filmmakers,Beginner Filmmakers- Get out and shoot mobile,"I keep seeing a lot of posts with beginners asking for cameras to fit their budget. Most looking for the cheapest options. To start with use your phone especially if you have an iPhone. The iPhone 12 can shoot in 10bit log using the Filmic Pro app. So you can grade the 4K footage properly in Resolve. On top of it the smartphone stabilisers are cheap. DJI osmo is a decent line and compatible with Filmic Pro app. Check out the options with the app. https://www.filmicpro.com/products/cinekit/

Check out this review on a iPhone 12 vs bmpcc 6k. https://youtu.be/zfD9lm-FoYs

You can tell the difference but that’s standard iPhone footage. Now change the app so you can manually adjust the settings and change the lenses. Check out Sandmarc options for lenses.  https://www.sandmarc.com/

Invest other money into lighting, audio (record externally) and learn your camera angles, editing, colouring, etc. Learn how to shoot. Hollywood directors have shot shorts and films using this setup. If you have Netflix check out High Flying Bird that Steven Soderbergh shot with iPhone rigs. His second film with iPhone I believe after Unsane in 2018 and you can see the improvements. Zack Snyder shot his short Snow Steam Iron with his iPhone. 

Making films is about story telling. Learn to tell your story and later you can upgrade to other cameras if you like. If you were doing videography as a business, sure clients dont want to see you on set with an iPhone. But when you want to tell your story, don’t let not having a Red or Arri stop you. Lady Gagas music video Stupid Love was shot with iPhone. Other movies and scenes in movies have been made with mobile. Soderbergh shot his films for Netflix. 

Why waste money on a $600 camera body and then buying a lens when today’s mobile technology can shoot better quality footage? That money is better spent on lighting and other equipment you will need. Oh and take some editing classes and colouring classes online when you can. Something to get you started. Davinci Resolve is free and you can start learning that while starting small. 

Rant over. Just wanting to throw that out for people."

Filmmakers,How to AUTO Colorize Old Black and White Video Footage with A.I,
Filmmakers,Can someone break down the requirements and processes needed for a film to be compatible with Digital Cinema Package (DCP) conversion?,"TLDR: I don’t understand DCPs. If I wanted a company to turn my film into a DCP, could I just send them a MP4 file, or do I need to do something special/specific?

***

At this point I’ve skimmed my fair share of “What is a DCP” and “The fundamentals of DCP”-type articles and videos, and, frankly, I’m at a loss. I’m no industry professional, and most of my experience with [independent] filmmaking is in animation. Still, I recognize the importance of having DCP copies of your film—live action, animated, or otherwise—for film festivals, theaters, and even awards season. I haven’t gotten the most technical grasp of what a DCP is, but as far as a general one goes, I know it’s a collection of files and that it’s been the industry standard (as opposed to 35mm film) for the better part of a decade now.

I’ve recently started writing/story boarding/etc. a new project. I’m probably a year or two out from having even a decent rough cut, but I figure I’d want it to be submitted places beyond just YouTube. When I began truly reading up on the necessary late post-production to post-post-production(?) processes for a typical feature film, I learned what a DCP is. I’ve also learned that, knowing myself, I wouldn’t even remotely trust myself to personally do the conversion. I plan to go to SimpleDCP or Cinematiq or (insert other viable alternatives) when the time comes.

With this in mind, my main concern is that I’d use an editing software or some kind of file extensions that would result in a conflict during DCP-conversion down the line. When I look to file specifications provided by the conversion companies, I can’t really make heads or tails of it. SimpleDCP, for example, has their guidelines listed at this webpage ( https://simpledcp.com/technical-guidelines/submission-guidelines/ ), but most terms aside from those to do with resolution aren’t something I currently understand (Audio channels are like an entirely different language to me). Of course, I know I’d need to read up on this further down the line, but for now I’d just like an idea of how conscious I should be about file types, software, etc. [as it relates to DCP-compatibility] before I’ve wrapped up post-production.

To actually put all this into question form:
What needs to be done during film production (post-production especially) to ensure a film can be made a DCP? Is it a matter of having everything in a specific file type, organized in a specific way with a specific software? Or is it as simple as exporting an MP4 file from a video editing platform and submitting it to SimpleDCP?"
Filmmakers,Looking for Resources to Learn Sound Editing,"Hi all! I'm a film studies student in NC considering specializing in editing. I have taken two basic editing courses at my university and have become fascinated with all aspects of editing. However my university does not have any more advanced editing classes and I'm looking for more opportunities to learn how to elevate my work. 

I am reasonably proficient in how to work Adobe Premiere Pro for basic editing jobs but the training was minimal on color and sound editing. I know very little about the technical aspects of sound recording and design so I'm approaching this topic from the ground up. All I know to do is checkerboard tracks and add fades, and if it's noisy I slap on a de-noise effect but it sounds awful. 

It is very difficult for me to teach myself most software so, if available, I prefer a more comprehensive crash course approach to give me the background I need to move forward with specific questions on my own. The Adobe cerfication test prep has been the most effective for me, but I've gone through what my school offers on Premiere and want to go deeper. Any suggestions on free online courses, books, exercises, or YouTube channels, on sound mixing and editing? Thanks!"

Moreover, I would appreciate any advice, but consider I am living in  the Countryside of Austria"

Only a fraction of films have any value whatsoever and if you’re excellent but nobody’s ever heard of you, do you even have any value. Will all great filmmakers gain an audience eventually or will they be mostly destined to an existence of worthlessness because they weren’t lucky enough? If no one has ever seen your film, does it have any worth?

If so then the whole system is broken."

Filmmakers,Do you think it's more important for an aspiring filmmaker to spend more time reading or watching films?,"I've heard from many directors that the best way to become a better filmmaker is to simply watch more movies.  However, I've heard Kurosawa say that to make great films, you must constantly read and write.  I also recently watched a couple of interviews with Werner Herzog, and he seems to really stress the importance of reading.  He even said that he doesn't watch too many movies but instead spends more time reading.  

Generally, I tend to spend more of my time watching films, and I try to read at least one short story a day.  I'm wondering whether it may be more beneficial to allocate more time toward reading.  What are your thoughts?"

Imagine you make a movie and you have a script. I bet you have the visuals for all the scenes in your head - what mood, what sourroundings... So if you want to record a complex scene do you describe it to your technical stuff and they make proposings on how to do it best? Like using green screen or building a setting? If you using mainly green screen, do you later sit down with the CGI crew and tell them how it is supposed to look - the moodiness, the room, the lighting etc and they design it from your tellings or do they just get a rough info and built from there with their own suggestions? I mean in the end the movie should look like you envisioned it in your head and not how your CGI team made it.

I am a recent film school graduate who is looking to redo his post audio on his recent action short film. 

My film is titled **Monarch**, a story about a masked vigilante, with a newly found ability to teleport, as he races to uncover the dark secrets hidden inside a prominent research facility that gave him his powers.

I consider myself more of a story, creative person rather than a technical post-production type of person. I'm still learning how everything comes together, especially in the post-audio area.

\---

My main issue is my punches/hits in my action scenes sound fake. They either sound hollow or artificial. I have tried layering tracks working with levels. I just want to add a more dynamic effect to the sound to show the power and aggressiveness of the fighters.

Even my dialogue sounds flat at times and I'm not sure what effects would work to make it better.

TL;DR - I would like to know any suggestions on how to improve the audio across the board with my film. Even suggestions on videos or tutorials that could help.

So if anyone has any suggestions on a comparable camera upgrade that suits these characteristics that’s around the 1K range ish, that’d be fantastic.

I’m only 18 so I don’t need anything crazy. Also wondering if I should instead invest in lenses? Though I think the G7 is getting fairly dated. This is for short films and such.

Filmmakers,"Friend asked me to help produce his film with a $10,000 budget. I've never produced anything so I need advice on how to go about it","Hello everyone! I have a friend who reached out to me about 6 months ago and asked me to help produce his film. We both have a huge passion for film and both have discussed in the past how we would love to work with one another someday.......so I think the time has finally come. He is still working on the script and it's going to be a short feature (45 mins). He already has $10,000 set aside for the project. He told me he wants to use a most of the budget for a really nice camera, a sound guy and an editor. Although I do agree that all three of them are extremely important , I am not sure if that's the only things we should use the money on. Like I said, I've never produced anything but I do have some experience. I've made a short 15 mins documentary in which I directed and co-edited. I also interned for a super small production company (mostly technical work such as setting up cameras and lighting), so I am very much aware of the kinds things that go on behind the scenes. So do you guys have any advice for how should I go about this on a producing standpoint?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: First off, I would like to say THANK YOU to everyone who has given me advice and I feel slightly overwhelmed by the reality check I just got LOL. A few things I want to add :

1. The director/writer told me that it will not be a 45 mins feature but and actual feature (75-80mins). He has already made a short feature with the same budget ($10,000). So he is not completely inexperienced in any of this. It's still in the editing process .
2. This feature requires little to no actual costumes. Actors will be wearing their own clothes and the women we choose will have to do their own makeup. There will be little to no VFX. I have some experience in After Effects so any cool tittles or any VFX, I think I can pull it off. I am also experienced with Premier Pro so I can also co-edit or be an editing assistant if need be. Music will not be a huge deal since we both have MANY friends who make music and would be more than happy to either make original music (at a low cost) OR allow us to use some of their already made music for a low price as well.
3. He said he can get back-end deals...whatever that means? He also said we can start a GOFUNDME . But I strongly doubt anyone is going to donate to any no name filmmakers
4. LOCATIONS and PERMITS are not going to be a HUGE problem since most scenes will be inside a house except for a couple of bar scenes. He works for a family owned restaurant and he already has the greenlight from the owner that they can shoot there for FREE .Also, food is a BIG thing and feeding the crew will be EXTREMELY pricey especially if we shoot for more than two weeks. The only solution I have for this buying cheap food and having my mom make it (I would most likely pay her out of my own pocket) .
5. Most of you guys are telling me to ditch the feature idea and to make a short instead (less than 15 mins). I honestly feel like this is a way better idea so now I need to think about how I should convince him.
6. Someone said that that if I want to stick to my budget, I have to be willing to wear MANY hats. I 100% agree with this. There are many positions that I feel I could do that can save us A LOT of money. I also know a bunch of other people with great cameras that would be willing to help for a extremely low price.

Big thanks to all of you guys who put crazy amount of thought and advice into my post. I will be taking your advice into deep consideration.  u/A_NightBetweenLives , u/PUBGM_MightyFine u/DavidJ_989 u/TakenByDeletedAc u/EvelioandZgroup u/sneakymarco u/bangladeshiswamphen u/MouSieeeee u/iLikeTelevision u/LibraryAppropriate34 u/darthawesome94 u/newyorkfromlive u/TreviTyger u/EvilDaystar"

Filmmakers,Tips for making friends on set?,"I'm three weeks into a six-week shoot on a film production. I'm a Trainee AD, but I'd rather be working in the camera department. On my previous job I made friends with the camera team after working with the DIT a lot (I collected the rushes so I had to go to him), but on this one I don't know anyone.

I'm friendly and say hi to everyone, having a bit of banter in between takes, but I wouldn't exactly be friends with others.

Perhaps I don't fully understand how this is to be used. How do you folks sync audio with a field recorder like the F6?"
Filmmakers,Tips for networking?,"I'm three weeks into a six-week job on a production as a Trainee AD, the biggest role I've had on a film or TV production.

I want to make sure I can secure another job before this one ends. I've always struggled with this, or making contacts. I can talk away and be friendly with everyone on set, but I always feel to nervous to ask them what they're going on to next or if they can recommend me to others. I'm always afraid I'm coming off like I'm just asking favours rather than being friendly and eager.

Rip them with MakeMKV and handbrake them into a file format that one can actually edit, but...

I recently realized how many times a fake UI is used when characters are using computers or the internet in movies, and thought it would be great fun to make some of those.

I’m more than happy to work on this for free in my spare time if it’s a quick thing, so if you’re working on a low budget project and need something small like this then shoot me a message and let me know! (Think like a character using a Facebook-like thing or performing a Google-like search in a scene). Happy to discuss details and see if we would be a good match.

Having said this, I really don’t want to take away paid work from professionals who work on these things for a living, so please only contact me if you really don’t have budget and it’s a very small thing that wouldn’t make sense for a full VFX company to work on.

Filmmakers,"Hi, I won the 2020 Slamdance Screenwriting Competition with my script OUR GODS WITHIN. I'm willing to talk to ANYONE about ANYTHING regarding writing, production, filmmaking, etc...","Hey [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/)Filmmakers

I'm a writer/director/producer and member of the WGA Independent Writer's Caucus. Recently, I wrote a script entitled OUR GODS WITHIN, which won the 2020 Slamdance Screenwriting Competition (... and has gone onto to place in other competitions and film festivals). It's an intimate drama splashed against a sci-fi backdrop. *It tells the story of an ailing wife who struggles to care for her dying husband after he contacts a space-borne illness while working on a decommissioned space elevator that bankrupted their small town.* I like to think it's AMOUR meets ANNIHILATION.

You can view the pitch reel I cut here: [https://vimeo.com/435191506](https://vimeo.com/435191506)

I originally wrote this screenplay with the intention of directing and never intended to really submit to competitions/festivals... *until covid hit*. So, truthfully it was a surprise when it did so well at Slamdance, especially since I understand it's not everyone's cup of tea. I'm very appreciative to them and can't recommend submitting to their competition enough. They're GREAT and very much worth the entry fee. That win lead to reads and meetings that would've never happened otherwise.

That being said, I wanted to post my project on this sub because I think it's a great resource for writers of all levels. Currently, I'm pitching the project and am working to attach talent, above and below the line. I'm also working with two producers who have helped finance two theatrically released indie features, but **I'm willing to talk to anyone ABOUT anything** **regarding the script** (... or writing, production, etc. in general). I've been at it for almost 15 years now and in that time I've learned a lot, and although i'm not the most successful or talented writer in this sub, the biggest lesson I've learned is that *every filmmaker should take their craft in their own hands and learn to produce.* You really have to put skin in the game to set yourself apart in this industry because there are literally **millions** of other filmmakers screaming into the Hollywood void. Invest in yourself - no one else is going to do it for you.

*Or, just be a social media celebrity...*

Filmmakers,Want to compare film salaries/budget across the globe?,"This may be a sensitive subject for some but don’t you want to see how film budget/salaries in filmmaking compare in different parts of the world?

Since the price of gears are almost the same wherever you are in the world, different salaries would mean different return on investment, so let’s see where in the world filmmaking is the most lucrative.

We could look at different types of budget (films/corporate/Weddings...) or salaries for a specific job, depending on what you have informations about. 

Like, from where I am from (country down below) : 
- The average feature film budget would be around : 10.000$ (Tbh, the industry is in its early stage here)

- A 30sec to 1min advertisement for a startup company could be between : 50$-400$ (shooting + editing)

- An established company would pay between : 200$ - 2000$ for the same Ad.

- A music video budget is between : 50$ - 1000$ (that’s rare though, avg is 300$) (shooting + editing)

- A typical wedding is usually between : 50$-150$ (shooting + editing)

- An editor charges around 50$ to edit up to 5 minutes of video (but most of the time the director is the DP and also the editor)

- A camera operator would charge around 75$ (and they bring their own gear)

That’s what I can say so far, and the country in question is Madagascar, I would be very curious to see how it is for other countries. 

Thank you !"

Filmmakers,"Wanna become a movie director, a piece of advice for beginners?","Hello everybody! I never thought that I will be interested in movie production, and I pursued utterly different goals. But, last summer, I became so interested in movie production, so I decided to choose it as my college major. Before that, I was thinking of studying law or finance, but everything has changed for me in one summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in time, I’ve been looking for a part-time job for the summer. All my peers went to work at different stores and restaurants, but I didn’t want to do the same thing. I’ve got lucky that nearby one group of students were filming something for their final project. They looked for a bunch of crowd actors who will help them. I was too shy to be filmed even in a student project, but I asked them if I can assist them in some other things. So they hired me as an assistant, and I used to do different tasks there. It was interesting though, I’ve uploaded a picture of the process below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bterauqd89471.jpg?width=349&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=628b476deb4e2025e2bc80788177860ce3a40fd3

&amp;#x200B;

Later, the director filming that project started to share his experience working with the camera and some nuances on a movie filming. I never thought that the whole process itself can be so interesting. After that, I even started to think about how my favorite movies and TV series are filmed. I began to pay attention to small details while watching the movie. Besides, the whole process became a piece of art for me, and I’m not talking about movies that are based only on special effects. He also told, that they cannot upload their films on some well-known sites, but they usually use services like this one — [https://9hd.la/](https://9hd.la/). I’ve noticed they have a bunch of different movies I’ve never heard before. Usually, I was skeptical about sites like this one.

&amp;#x200B;

After that experience, I’m seriously planning to apply for a movie production degree. Besides, I heard that some colleges in the UK are excellent in my primary choice. I haven’t decided yet where I will go studying, but I’m pretty sure that it will be in the movie industry. So I wonder if someone can recommend me to any good colleges in the USA and UK."

We have a strong creative vision, but are looking for someone that can help us with the process and of course bring their own ideas to the table.  We are looking for someone of Arab descent or of color, but preferably a member of a diaspora. If you or anyone you know fits this profile, please message me!

Additionally- if anyone knows of other forums to find directors, please let me know. Thanks!"
Filmmakers,Scammed by my own producer.,"Hey guys,

I have a very specific question and want to make it short, but some story-time is unfortunately necessary. I also want to excuse my english - it isn’t my native language.

A producer from Germany asked me to write and direct a feature with a budget of 15.000 euros. He didn’t want to be involved creativley, so I had free hands to do whatever I wanted. He just wanted his own little goldmaking blumhouse-like movie.

Thats what he said, at least.

So he leant back and let me do everything needed for the movie. I wrote, found the crew, talents and actors, a location, everything, while he did nothing.

After the shooting was finished, he asked me in his office. He wanted me to fake bills for a state film funding, bills with my „gage” on it. I just have to write the bill for him and sign a paper where I confirm that I received my gage in cash, which is, of course, not the case. I live in Europe and its normal here to finance movies with these fundings but you have to proof that you are giving some of your own money in as well. But my producer didn’t want to touch his own money. He wanted the state to pay for the movie and put all the money the movie earns in his pocket.

Anyways, the state here is very strict when it comes to scamming them. So I refused to fake the bills and well, he said, okay, If you don’t do that, I will kill your movie, because I own the rights (final-cut included\*) and you own nothing. Which is not entirely true: He doesn’t have the footage and he never saw any footage or dailies of the film nor visited the set. I think he doesn’t even read the script properly. He ""just"" owns the movie-rights.

I hired a lawyer and told him everything, showed all the emails and he immediately agreed to work for me pro bono. He tried a lot of things, but the producer hired a lawyer as well. And they are not interested in any compromise. They just want to postpone it as long as possible.

We could win in court, my lawyer said, but it would take us many years to do so.

The position of the producer is ""Well, you signed the contract with me. I can give you your movie-rights back - for 25.000 euros and 1/3 of every penny the movie will make after that, if you don’t pay - I’ll kill the movie. I don’t care about the lost 15.000 euros.""

He also threatened to ruin my reputation and that he has a huge network in movie business I should afraid of. So he did to my editor.

I, of course, don’t have 25.000 euros. But I have the movie. And I had the support of many, many filmmakers. Together we accomplished the post-production since one year, we got studios, soundmixing, an orechestra and color-grading, together worth thousands and thousands of euros, for free, which was absolutely awesome.

I owe them a movie release. But because of the legal situation, no festival-release is possible anymore. I submitted to one and they really liked and gave the movie a plattform and said the movie will have a huge festivaltour - but the producer also threatened them and they gave me the advice to not submit to any festivals til the war is over.

So, I can’t distribute the movie legally. 

What would you do in my place? I really thought about releasing the movie on YouTube or something like that, but Im unsure about the consequences. 

Thank you for your help and your posts in advance!

Greetings

\*I was young, dumb and wanted to make my first feature. Of course I wanted to have the final cut, but the producer said its ""just formal"" for the state funding and he has no interest in being involved creativley. I insisted of the final cut and he said „ok, no movie then“, so well, I signed. Take this as a reminder for not signing any contracts without a lawyer, kids. 

P.S.: It was a horror movie."

Filmmakers,Advice on equipment for highschool communication arts program,"I am but a humble high school English and cinema teacher. The only experience I have in film is from a couple college electives in 2004 and what I have taught myself to effectively teach my class the last 10 years. That said, I've read and taught myself a lot with limited resources available, meaning I understand the art side of things a lot more than the technical side. 

Long story short, my district has their eye on me to start a larger communication arts program at the school. The program will include journalism, filmmaking, and livestreaming, so I would need equipment for both high quality stills and video photography, sound equipment, lighting, and other accessories in those realms. 

I've spent the last couple days obsessively researching this stuff on reddit and various internet rabbit holes. I've got my eyes on stuff like Ronin gimbals, Rode directional mics, Zoom sound recorders, some basic soft box lighting setups on Amazon, etc. 

Then of course there's the cameras and lenses. I went into this thinking a few simple Nikon 3500s and nice lenses would do the trick, but then I got reading about mirrorless and cinema cameras and talked myself up to stuff like the Panasonic g85 or even the black magic 4k. 

As much as these equipment setups may be out of my league with my lack of experience, I am very confident I can grow into them. And the more I learn and am able to acquire, the more successful my program and students will be. 

The most interesting part here is my district has made it very clear money isn't an issue. I've literally been told to ""ask for the moon."" They never sink money into things like this, so I don't want to waste the opportunity with just a few beginner items that will have to last me ten years when I can get some really good stuff that I can learn to use over the next ten years, during which time I highly doubt they'll buy us anything else. 

Does anyone have any advice or recommendations for things I should ask for to make this film/journalism/streaming program the best it can be? Thank you in advance."

Filmmakers,Is my low budget enough to pay a film maker?,"I'm from Toronto and I am about to launch a niche clothing online store and I was wondering if $250-$300 dollars is enough to pay a hobbyist/ film student or a freelancer for a day of filming and editing using his own equipment (a DSLR / goPro or a decent film camera will do).

I will provide 6-8 sets of clothing, two models, transportation and food/drinks.

The clothing ad will be under 2 minutes max duration and editing part will be light provided we get good raw footage (I'd like some cinematic look, color grading, scene transitions, footage stabilizing and some typography).

I will credit the filmmaker at the end of the ad and willing to provide reference for his work if he needs me to.

Someone tell me if this is a viable idea?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: 

I will remove any post production tasks. Guy I will hire will only do filming and some photo shoots.

Also I'm only hiring anyone within an hour of downtown Toronto. "
Filmmakers,I made a short film at the beach with my friends. Here's how it went.,"Link to ""Chips... and Fish"" (shortfilm): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OjVi-cB6HU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OjVi-cB6HU)

I wrote the script for this a few weeks ago and shot and edited it last weekend. I'd never done something like this before (outside of basically testing out the camera settings) but I'm really happy with the result.

Here's a rough time line:

\&gt; I got into writing during lock-down and have now written a couple of short-film scrips, about half a feature and also a first draft for 2 shortish books.

\&gt; I purchased (probably too much) camera/recording equipment a couple of months ago and wanted an opportunity to try it out.

\&gt; Wrote the script &gt; did one zoom rehearsal with some friends and then tried to get a day when everyone was availabe. All contact was sorted through a whatsapp group.

\&gt; We had to cancel 3 times because of bad weather, but then got ideal/slightly overcast conditions on the day and no rain which was great.

\&gt; My GF and I showed up the beach an hour earlier than everyone else to setup and record establishing shots and foley.

\&gt; Everyone else arrived, we did a few run throughs with just the script (which I had printed out for everyone - made a massive checklist of things to do the night before that was mostly charging a million things up - but this checklist was ESSENTIAL)

\&gt; then we recording sound as backup, did a few takes of that

\&gt; Then we went it at it. I'd done a basic storyboard and wanted to keep things ""simple"" and focus on shot reverse shot with a tracking shot of the couple walking.

\&gt; So i got a full run through of the script facing both ways, twice for safety (just have the one camera)

\&gt; Then tried some different angles but mostly stuck to the shot reverse shot.

\&gt; Then we had coffee and rapped up. I went home and edited the whole thing. Shooting + rehearsal on the day was about 2.5 hrs. Syncing everything in post and editing was like 5-6hrs.

&amp;#x200B;

Equipment used:

Sony A7ii + Kit lens

Glidecam Hd-2000 for tracking shots (I know, not very stable. I'll get into that in a mo)

Deity Video mic pro in the rode blimp

Boom pool (can't remember but it's like a mid range internally cabled one)

Zoom f6 recorder and orca bag

Sony vegas for editing.

&amp;#x200B;

Main takeaways

\&gt; I'm still figuring out the glidecam. My setup is probably a bit light and I haven't been able to get it balanced 100%, even at home. I think i need to make the top heavier so i can put more weight on the bottom and also extend the pole. Atm if i need to pole super short to get the right drop time, which means it wobbles around more because physics. On the day it was windy and i kept changing the focal length without re-balancing (because wind and lazy). But i think the result is still better than handheld would have been for trying to walk backwards. Even if the horizon occasionally goes WAHEY, I'm A DUTCH ANGLE NOW.

\&gt; Clean your lens. I didn't spot the smudges on my dirty lens until I was editing. Woops.

\&gt; If you don't have a clapperboard... CLAP. I just got one of the guys to clap on camera at the start of each take and syncing was pretty straightforward. It might not be perfect at points but I'm happy enough.

\&gt; Even overcast, it was WAY brighter than i expected. I had the ISO at minimum of 200, aperture was at F20 and shutter speed at 1/50. I was originally intending to shoot at like F4 but the extra depth of field ended up helping me keep focus with my shitty glidecam skills. In the last twenty minutes of shooting, I had to put shutter speed to 1/100 just to stop the image being overexposed. Which isn't ideal but i think it isn't too noticable.

\&gt; When recording dialogue on location with a shotgun mic, don't have the sea behind the actors. Some of the takes had the boom mic facing the sea and the SEA IS FUCKING LOUD. It sounds like a waterfall and I basically had to bin off those takes.

\&gt; I had completely overlooked the role of script supervisor. One of my friends who wasn't acting or shooting (I did camera. My GF was boom mic operator) was there and I was worried they'd get bored with nothing to do... Oh how naive that was haha. They were ESSENTIAL to keeping track of lines. It's hard to do 3 jobs at once, so as soon as I was behind the camera I completely forgot about the script and keeping track of the actor's performances. I was so focused on trying to get half decent footage.

\&gt; Be nice, be respectful. No one got paid. This was all for fun (and as a technical exercise for glidecam and rode blimp in wind). I did my best to be organised and keep moral high, and I'm happy to make myself available in any capacity to any fun projects they might have.

\&gt; Remember to have fun. My experience was really great. Everyone wanted to be there and we'd done enough planning/checklist making that nothing major was forgotten and there were no bad hiccups. I'm sure everything i ever work on wont be so smooth. But that doesn't make you can't be optimistic about this stuff. Yes, I was kinda nervous getting up to it and i was annoyed we had to keep cancelling because of weather. But once we on the beach, everything went great.

Happy to answer any questions :)"

I am starting video editing and filmmaking for personal purposes and i struggle with two things and I thing you guys might help me.  

  

1- I have a pretty powerful computer, i am using Da Vinci Resolve, and the video card just struggles with GPU memory. Always full, and getting some lags when i have longer timelines. I was wondering if there is any free or one time purchase software you are using so i can switch from Resolve? I don't want to pay a monthly fee for Premiere, but i don't mind spending a little bit on a tool. (Or should i just upgrade my video card?)   

  

2- I have trouble finding good free music. Same as #1, i don't want to pay a monthly fee for a database since i only do a couple videos a year, but i don't mind paying some money to artists and platforms for good content. Are there any paying but reasonnably priced services for music, effects, etc?

For reference, I’ll link below one of the shorts that I was thinking of sending to a local festival. Hadn’t even figured out the camera at that point so the lighting is all over the place, but at the same time, it’s a short. It tells a story which makes it a film the same as everyone else’s (regardless of quality), no?

Filmmakers,Should you pay the subject of a documentary?,"I'm getting ready to produce and direct my first documentary, which is about a minor celebrity. I'm meeting with them and their team soon to discuss, and I suspect that they will ask to be paid for appearing in the doc. I of course don't think anyone should work for free, but I don't know what's standard for documentaries.

There will be a few interviews with them, but I don't think it will require extended periods of shooting that will interfere with their life. I'm already planning on offering a small stipend to other interviewees for their time and gas money, and can do the same for the subject. We have room in the budget to pay subject's usual talent fees, which are in the low five figures. My concern is that paying the subject will affect the integrity of the project, or that other people in their life (including some other minor celebrities) who are being interviewed will also expect payment.

Is it normal to pay the main subject or anyone else appearing in a doc? Instead of paying them upfront, should we agree to pay them a fee or percentage when it's sold? Will paying them affect the integrity of the film?"

I do not like, however, the daily turnaround of news reporting and determining even what is “news.” Each story I do, I wish I could devote a month to and have more elaborate filming and a more developed message to deliver. 

My question is what kind of career or organization should I pursue from here? I thought about seeking out opportunities (internships, job shadows, careers) with programs such as National Geographic, The History Channel, or Discovery.

What's the bare minimum amount of lighting equipment for an indoor, two-day film shoot? The look: low lighting, like the sex worker house from Taxi Driver. The budget is 3k, including camera package rental, lunch, crafty, props, and costumes. 

Hi, Everyone. I am in the throes of pre-production for my short film, and I feel I am being nicked around by people who want to rent the nicest equipment for their own reel. Which, I understand, but for a five-minute short film, I feel like it does not need to have cinema-level equipment. Maybe I just do not have the right people for the job. 

If this helps, here is the synopsis: When a naive virgin unknowingly solicits a cannibalistic prostitute, he is forced to fight for this life before he ends up on her plate.

The tone is dark comedy if that helps with the look. It takes place at night, but we're blacking out the windows and shooting during the day. I want to use multiple practical lamps and candles, as the cannibal's home is disguised to look like a prostitute's room. Any advice and suggestions are more than welcome. Thanks!"

Filmmakers,Self-produce or find a producer for my first microbudget feature or put my energy towards more writing samples?,"So March of last year, after years of pushing for it, I finally moved to LA from San Diego with my fiance to pursue my filmmaking dreams. I'd saved a decent amount of money from my bar job and (mostly) quit (I was going to stay on as the booker for as long as it made sense). I have a labor-of-love script I've been working for years that finally made the rounds and made the QFs twice-each in Page and Bluecat and made the QFs/Semis/Finals in a few other notable fests/comps. It's a film I intend on directing, but I don't think it could be done for less than $4-$5 million, at least. I've been making shorts and music videos for twenty-five years, since I was fifteen, and in the last few years some of those were no-budget videos for some big-in-the-indie-world acts with which I'm pretty happy.

Two years ago this month, I figured I'd be better off getting something together much smaller to just write and direct myself to hopefully kick things off. After another weekend in the desert, I willed a new, small-scale idea into existence, and spent the next few months making notes, slowly outlining, bringing a friend on to start working on some music, brought on a cinematographer buddy who's excited to work with me, and started figuring out my access to other resources (crew and locations, etc.). My job at the time, bartending/booking/managing a popular bar/venue, took a lot of my attention, but in the last couple of months before we moved, as we were driving up to LA and back looking for a place, I carved out a few hours here and there to start getting the screenplay down on the page, banging out the first act pretty quickly. We moved to LA on March 8th, with my intentions to try and raise at least $40k from friends and business owners and shoot in late May/early June for twelve days, but as we all know, a week later everything shut down. I was really on edge up until the new administration took over and wasn't productive at all in any big way in that time. 

Now that vaccinations have sped up so much (although we're close to hitting a wall with this anti-vax bullshit) and I've started to regain a sense of self and focus, I'm trying to figure out what my best course of action is for the rest of the year. Part of the process my last couple of months has partly been regaining my confidence after feeling like even more an outsider this past year, and I'm starting to feel good again about the microbudget feature. I also got my other script into the hands of a literary manager last year but never heard anything back. The tricky thing with the microbudget feature is that it takes place out in Yucca Valley/Joshua Tree, and I know I need to schedule past the heat of the summer. I'm getting married on Oct. 2nd, so basically sometime not long after that.

My question now is: is it a better idea for me to try and shoot the feature in a few months or spend my time and energy finishing another couple of spec scripts that I've been slowly outlining and push more for representation? I'm somewhat familiar with fundraising resources along the lines of Seed+Spark, and some of my original plan for raising money from friends and local businesses is somewhat out the window, as most of those were bars/restaurants that are just now finding their footing again, if they managed to survive the pandemic. I really wanted to make sure I could stick to my vision for the microbudget feature, which is more of a drama with thriller/horror/sci-fi elements, and I worry about trying to sell the idea to a producer. I do have a few contacts in the film world here in LA and need to reach out more, but I guess I don't really know what truly-independent filmmaking is looking like now that things are opening back up. The feature has four characters total, mostly following one, and I was planning on having a small, tight crew, with a couple of student PAs from the film program a friend is in up here. Of course I'd want to make sure everyone is safe and vaccinated, but I know we'd still have to make sure we're testing to some regular degree. I also know that productions up here are pretty suddenly in full force again after being backlogged, so I'm hoping that if I get as much in place as possible on my own, it'd be easier to bring on an outside producer/work with a company to help open up the scope of casting and locations. I just don't know how feasible this all this year and can't really wrap my head around it. The other option is just stick to writing a couple of other things I've been working on to serve as samples and push more for the writing angle for the time being. 

Sorry this is so long-winded, again I pushed really hard to try and jumpstart my filmmaking career right before the pandemic hit and this all really important to me. I turn 41 in a couple of months, and after having just lost more than a year, I don't want to lose any more time. Thanks in advance for any advice from any of you in the community."

Filmmakers,Finished my first short in a year.,"And I feel like distancing myself from it. 

The story was 3 months in the making, underwent 12 rewrites. Was completely shot in 2 days because the principal actor will be leaving the country for grad school soon. I don't have heavy gear, just a standard camera and tripod, plus a lav mic. I structured the story really well but it involves a lot of plot and character development in 10 minutes so when I edited the footage together, it looked... stupid?

That was incredibly painful. I assume music will take a lot of that away as there are a few montages but I've been subtle with a lot of explanations in the plot and I'm beginning to worry it might confuse the audience or be ""senseless"". My parents couldn't understand the screenplay and that was the first blow, but apparently everyone else did. Now, I am having real concerns about it and worry about the mass viewing audience having an experience like my parents. And it's not like they're dumb; they're both PhDs, so that's got me really bummed the way I'm delivering the story. 

There's been erratic weather all week long. It's either heavy rain or extreme sunshine, both which are undesirable. Can't shoot in the rain and the sunshine leaves the image heavily overexposed. But my hands were completely tied. This was the best I could do and I'm afraid that the central theme which I came to after months of introspection, a theme that means a lot to me personally won't be conveyed properly, and all this hardwork will be wasted. Sound's fucked too- continuity issues.

This is supposed to be my film school application short. I can't sit and write another one. I poured my heart and soul into this. I'll be working with a sound guy right now, and hope for the best. I'll add subtitles even, so I can salvage what remains.

Have any if you experienced this before? I'm not asking what to do, because it's weird and for the first time in my life I know exactly what to do to (hopefully) fix this. It's just that I don't want to dislike my baby."

There is this one lady who seems to be the reference person (a lot of questions are answered by “you should ask L”) so I was hoping to have her be the main voice-tell her story but I haven’t made great rapport with her and am not sure it’ll happen in time. I’ve become quite friendly with a few of the other members of the group and talked to them about my prokect - they seemed to like the idea.

Go there one evening, say hey can I film y’all smoking, drinking and talking? Have the camera in my hand? On a tripod? Take them somewhere more private one by one? Have them show me the garden? Then again, camera or tripod? Do little groups?

I recently came across a completely plagiarized \*remake\* of my film. The channel has almost 400k subscribers and his plagiarized copy of my film has over 700k views. I've already found multiple other videos on his channel that are plagiarized and suspect that this may be true of everything on his channel.

I filed a DMCA takedown; I received an email back saying they are concerned my claims may be ""fraudulent"", and that I must provide supporting info within 7 days or my account will be terminated.

I sent them a bunch of evidence as to my ownership of my film (news articles, IMDB, etc.), as well as a  side-by-side comparison of plagiarized scenes. Waiting to hear back.

Filmmakers,"Our indie film is screening for a week. We’re looking for advice on how to distribute it, and frankly, make some money so we can make another film :)","Hey, everyone, 

I wanted to share that the first film that I ever worked on, “Josef – Born in Grace”([IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11237638/)), is screening this week as part of the Indian Panorama week hosted by the Indo Cine Appreciation Foundation. The film stars Victor Banerjee and Subrat Dutta, and is directed by Susant Misra.

It’s a film that’s very close to my heart. My grandfather wrote the story that it’s based on and my father’s been waiting to make it a film for over a decade. It helped me realise that I really wanted to work in the film industry and was a large factor in how I met my wife (who was the costume designer)!

I was the assistant EP during the shoot and have been pushing the marketing and sales efforts as I can using my limited capabilities and budget, along with my wife. 

The film has been selected at, and won awards in, festivals around the world. Where we’re struggling is getting word out about the film and figuring out distribution. 

You can see a trailer for the film on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/k7UiV1fkipg), read more about it on [our website](http://uakathachitra.com/josefborningrace).

ICAF is letting non-members watch the film until June 13th by request through email. You can use this mailto link: https://tinyurl.com/RequestJosefLink. It should create a filled out email that you can just click send on.

I’d love it if you could watch the film and let me know what you think! I am also happy to take any advice on distribution you might have. We're complete newbies in the industry, and so far, we've come up blank with every distribution channel that we've approached. It's been frustrating to say the least."

Since i really want direct something and go for it, I’m thinking of writing the found footage version of it and get it done as soon as possible.. and probably in many years, when I got the means to make the *movie I actually want it to be* I’ll just remake it.

Filmmakers,Filmmaker's Guide in Tackling Creative Block,
Filmmakers,Microphones or not ? Filming with stuntmen,"First of all, I'm a student in sound engineering in a cinema school. I have been engaged in a filming for a short movie which starts tomorrow.

The movie contains absolutely no dialogues, but it contains many, MANY stunts. Actually, the main actors are stuntmen. Usually, I put (lapel) microphones on the actors to hear them, but because of the stunts and the absence of dialogues I'm not sure of what to do. I'm hesitating between 3 solutions :

1. Putting the microphones with many, MANY gaffer (=strong tape) on the inside of the clothes. It might bother the actors, but at least it would be fixed and I would have the sound of their breathing, their stunts, their screams etc.
2. Not putting any microphones. The actors won't be bothered by the microphones, but the only sounds I would have would be the sounds of the boom (because there will be a boom operator with me).
3. Putting the microphones with pliers. However, the thing is that I have no pliers, I'm not sure if my school would give me some and I'm really afraid that the actors might be hurt by them while doing their stunts.

I feel like the first solution is the best, but I'm afraid that the actors will be bothered by the taped microphones on their clothes. Also, what if they fall right on the microphones ? If anyone can help, it would mean so much to me !

EDIT : [this](https://www.thomann.de/fr/sennheiser_ew_112p_g4_gb_band.htm?glp=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4pfx7PKD8QIVchoGAB3yXwYFEAQYASABEgL3yvD_BwE) is the kind of microphones I will be using. I can't use something else because the material is given by the school and I have no money (and skills) to buy something else.

EDIT 2 : I know that using gaffer on a costume is an absolute monstruosity, I'm just desperate.

EDIT 3 : for today (first day of filming) I will do solution 2 and use the boom only. I will try to put the microphones (with barnier) if there are scenes where the actors aren't moving too much, and I will see if it works out. Thank you so much guys !"
Filmmakers,My First Demo Reel,
Filmmakers,Does the Ronin S Focus Wheel work with a GH5 + Viltrox EF + Canon 50mm?,"Can anyone confirm this before I purchase it? I should preface by saying my Canon 50mm autofocus is broken so I can only use manual (which I don’t mind), but I was wondering if the Ronin S Focus Wheel somehow relies on that? Or if it would even work with my lens in the first place as that would be a deal breaker if it can’t."
Filmmakers,Thoughts on how to take the next step and make sure it's upward and not sideways.,"Some thoughts on where I am at this early stage of my career in film and television. I'd love anyone else's thoughts on these pivot points that we face every so often. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do we do when we feel capable of more, but are seemingly stuck where we are?

We use our intuition.

We plan ahead.

We use the tools, time, and opportunities at our disposal to set up what hopefully will be a step in the right direction.

At 29, I finally find myself on the right track career-wise. I’m working on a TV show as the data wrangler, and I get to see cool stuff everyday. However, this isn’t where I want to be. It's a step in the right direction, it’s a long way from where I started as a barista/philosophy degree holder with a lifelong love of film, but it isn’t where I want to be. It’s just in the right neighborhood. Now I have to make sure I get to the right house. Which means my next move is even more important. It’s a pivot point that will guide every move I make afterwards. 

So what do I want to do next? What do I need to do so that I get the most of what comes next? What do I not like about what I’m doing now, and how can I set myself up so that I can avoid the pitfalls of this job in the next one?

First and foremost, I want actual responsibility. I want creative responsibility. I want the pressure of a project to fall on my shoulders in a meaningful way. As a DIT, I’m merely filling a role that is for the convenience of everyone else. I’m completely expendable and I don’t like that. I want to feel my value and I want to clock in and earn it every single day. Right now, on most days it wouldn’t matter if I was there or not. I need more from a job than just a paycheck. I want the accountability of my actions to hold significance. Essentially, I want to be QB1. I want the ball to touch my hands every play, no matter what. I want to be important, I want to feel important, and I want to feel the responsibility of my importance. 

So that was a paragraph full of “I want’s”, that’s great and it shows ambition, but how do we actually turn those desires into reality? 

We force the world to deal with who we are. We assert our strengths and show that we are willing to improve upon our weaknesses. Additionally, we use those strengths to assist and push those around us. A culture of collaboration leads to a culture of growth. If we want to lead and hold significant responsibility, then we need to be the type that exudes not only confidence, but also wisdom. And wisdom in a sense, that you are approachable and flexible. Aside from displaying confidence, I believe what is necessary to display that one is ready for a position of such significance is to show that they have the necessary skills. That means a strong portfolio or reel, and a knowledge of the small yet important things that are essential to the functions of production and business.

In all, to make the right next step. One must assert themselves with the knowledge that while they are capable, they are also still a student of life and of the profession. They must also make sure to discern the flashy opportunities from the real and genuine opportunities for growth in order to avoid the anxiety and frustrations of being more capable than their opportunity. It is something that takes time and deserves the proper attention. It requires the awareness that to obtain and fulfill such a position, one must commit themselves equally to their desires of success and also to the common goal of holding a role that is weighted with significance and accountability.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Work hard. Be confident. Be aware. Be open."

Is worth going all out on the pro bundle?"

Filmmakers,How do I (and should I) transition into film with no prior experience?,"For context, I went to a tech school for 4 years and earned my engineering degree. During that time, however, I figured that I wasn't as passionate as I thought I would be. During my time there, I started a film club and got so invested in it that most nights it would be my top priority: I'd organize the meeting notes/lessons over doing my homework/studying, spending most of my time outside classes in the film room storyboarding or editing, and even staying up to 7 AM on a school night to finish a shoot with the team. We didn't really achieve much, won a couple of small awards and  1 official selection in the student cateogry of a film festival, but being a part of that group was the greatest highlight of my college days.

After graduating, I looked into pursuing medicine and got a great research job at a top university, and a few scientific publications. However, I feel bored in lab most days and struggle with motivational issues. I know that I can get into medical school decently easily if I put some effort into it, and the field interests me, but the way I feel doing research and studying isn't even remotely close to how I feel when I'm on a set.

I feel like I'm at a very important point in my life where I need to decide what I'm going to do for the rest of my life. I'm very aware of the competitiveness and the uncertainty of becoming a filmmaker. The logical side of me is pushing me to take the safe route, become a doctor and earn a very good living. But I also know that if finances didn't matter, filmmaking (specifically cinematography) would be my dream job. 

I read the pinned thread in this subreddit and it was very helpful. I don't care about the title of being a filmmaker. Every time I watch a movie, I am consciously thinking about the technical choices made in every frame and I can talk about the lighting in a scene or nitpick minutiae for hours. I know I'm passionate about it, but I also know that millions of people feel the same way and how few success stories there are. 

With no connections, no set experience, and no formal education but youtube videos and a couple of books, should I take the leap? I also live in a state where nothing really happens so I'd have to move if I want exposure. My parents are telling me to do a master's program, but that can be really expensive, and I know people have mixed feelings about its value. I'd love to get some wisdom and perspective from you guys, thanks!"
Filmmakers,My first film turned out to be a crypto mockumentary. I'd be keen to hear if you think i met my key objectives.,"Before i started this project i had a few objectives that i wanted to hold on to no matter what happened. These objectives acted like a ships navigation equipment, to help keep me on track and make sure that the projects goals stayed aligned and relevant to the subject matter.

Right up until i exported the film yesterday i was quite sure that the objectives were still in tact. However, now after watching the film several times, listening to the film and making numerous adjustments i'm less confident that i have met all my objectives.

What do you think?

How would this be does if budget was no object, and is there a way to execute it (in camera) with a smaller budget, or even no budget?

I have replicated this style of shot using after effects by using a slider and then just adding shake at the start and non at the end, but I was wondering how to do it in a practical way, as an action scene would be much easier for an operator if they actually had handheld control of the camera at the start?"

I’m curious if anyone has any ideas what I should do this time around? I feel like the deli meats is a bit problematic because everyone will be sticking their hands into the same bag of meat.

Filmmakers,Reaper and Reason - The Best Combo for Film Scoring,"I shot a short film and I needed a way to score it.

I first tried Ableton with Reason (rewired) and it was o.k. but a bit difficult to deal with.

Reason 11 was released and rewire was...sadly...eliminated.

So, I downloaded Reaper and used Reason as a VST and...it's awesome.

While watching your video in Reaper you can play in real time along with the footage in Reason.

It's basically a match made in heaven - Reaper handles the audio and video mix (basically the visuals you see on the screen and the audio you're playing).

Reason is the sound generator.

Once you've scored your footage you just export from Reaper/Reason, import your score into your NLE of choice along with the original footage, and that's it. It's all in time. If you don't like your take? 
Just do it again.

I highly advise everyone to check out Reaper with Reason as a VST.

It's the best way I've found to score a film.

p.s. You do need to know how to use a midi keyboard, and actually how to play music (or you can just fake it)."
Filmmakers,How do I add music for my short?,Id love to use a few songs I know from other artists but naturally there’d be copyright issues. How can I resolve this?
