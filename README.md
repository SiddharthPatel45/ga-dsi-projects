This repository contains my projects done as part of the General Assembly's [Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive/singapore) course.

### Project 1: SAT-ACT Analysis

In this project, we explore the participation rates for SAT & ACT standardization tests across the states in the US from years 2017 & 2018. The data was given and after performing basic cleaning as well as Exploratory Data Analysis, some conclusions were drawn based on the statistics of the dataset. Certain trends and relationships between the scores and participation rates were reasoned upon. Furthermore, outside research was conducted to understand the states' priority for taking one test over the other. As a statistician hired by the College Board, the goal was to make recommendations, based on our knowledge of exploring the data, to improve the participation rates for SAT.

### Project 2: Ames Housing Price Analysis
