This repository contains my projects done as part of the General Assembly's [Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive/singapore) course.

### Project 1: SAT-ACT Analysis

In this project, we explore the participation rates for SAT & ACT standardization tests across the states in the US from years 2017 & 2018. The data was given and after performing basic cleaning as well as Exploratory Data Analysis, some conclusions were drawn based on the statistics of the dataset. Certain trends and relationships between the scores and participation rates were reasoned upon. Furthermore, outside research was conducted to understand the states' priority for taking one test over the other. As a statistician hired by the College Board, the goal was to make recommendations, based on our knowledge of exploring the data, to improve the participation rates for SAT.

### Project 2: Ames Housing Price Analysis

Many factors affect the price of a property, whether it is an apartment or a house, how many rooms does it have and how big they are. In this project, we analyse the housing prices in the city of Ames, Iowa, and explore what factors affect the housing prices the most. Understanding the data helps us build linear regression models, train them, and then use to predic the sale prices of properties. The original dataset is from kaggle and the performance metrics used is root mean squared error (RMSE). As a data analyst we are tasked with the challenge to use this quantified housing data, and make analytical predictions for the property sale prices in the city, using simple machine learning methods.

### Project 3: Reddit API & Subreddit Classification

Using the text classification capabilities of some machine learning models, we try to analyse data collected from a public website on two similar but different topics, and train an algorithm which will classify the text as belonging to one or the other topic. This category of machine learning is known as NLP, or natural language processing, where a piece of code learns to understand the language we humans speak. This project is a very shallow dip into this field, in the sense that we use some very basic tools to achieve something impressive. The goal here is to classify a post from reddit correctly by predicting which subreddit it belongs to.
