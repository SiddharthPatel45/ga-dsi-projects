This repository contains my projects done as part of the General Assembly's [Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive/singapore) course.

### Project 1: SAT-ACT Analysis

In this project, we explore the participation rates for SAT & ACT standardization tests across the states in the US from years 2017 & 2018. The data was given and after performing basic cleaning as well as Exploratory Data Analysis, some conclusions were drawn based on the statistics of the dataset. Certain trends and relationships between the scores and participation rates were reasoned upon. Furthermore, outside research was conducted to understand the states' priority for taking one test over the other. As a statistician hired by the College Board, the goal was to make recommendations, based on our knowledge of exploring the data, to improve the participation rates for SAT.

### Project 2: Ames Housing Price Analysis

Many factors affect the price of a property, whether it is an apartment or a house, how many rooms does it have and how big they are. In this project, we analyze the housing prices in the city of Ames, Iowa, and explore what factors affect the housing prices the most. Understanding the data helps us build linear regression models, train them, and then use to predict the sale prices of properties. The original dataset is from kaggle and the performance metrics used is root mean squared error (RMSE). As a data analyst we are tasked with the challenge to use this quantified housing data, and make analytical predictions for the property sale prices in the city, using simple machine learning methods.

### Project 3: Reddit API & Subreddit Classification

Using the text classification capabilities of some machine learning models, we try to analyze data collected from a public website on two similar but different topics, and train an algorithm which will classify the text as belonging to one or the other topic. This category of machine learning is known as NLP, or natural language processing, where a piece of code learns to understand the language we humans speak. This project is a very shallow dip into this field, in the sense that we use some very basic tools to achieve something impressive. The goal here is to classify a post from reddit correctly by predicting which subreddit it belongs to.

### Project 4: West Nile Virus Analysis

Project link: https://github.com/SiddharthPatel45/west-nile-virus

Mosquitos are the main carrier of West Nile Virus that spread the disease from birds to humans. The city of Chicago has been facing some outbreaks of the virus and city's health department wants some solutions to tackle the mosquito population. This project is based on another kaggle competition, where we get our dataset, which has location information on some mosquito traps the city officials have set up, along with weather and spray data. We are to predict the presense of the West Nile Virus in a trap based on all the given data. This was a group project done by a team of three students.

### Final Project: Gravitational Wave Detection

Project link: https://github.com/SiddharthPatel45/gravitational-wave-detection

Gravitational Waves have been discussed since the beginning of the 20th century, and scientifically researched since the Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. They are caused by massive celestial bodies, like the Neutron Stars or Black Holes, when they accelerate they cause gravitational waves, in the form of waves, propagating through the curvature of space-time at the speed of light. These disturbances can be felt on the other side of the observable universe, but are extremely weak as they lose energy as gravitational radiation. These disturbances in space are be measured by some of the most sensitive instruments on the planet, one of which are laser interferometers operated by LIGO. These measurements are extremely tiny and are very susceptible to surrounding disturbances like vibrations from nearby equipments, seismic activity etc. That's where Machine Learning comes in, as the signals are buried in detector noise.

G2Net is a network of Gravitational Waves, Geophysics and Machine Learning. With the increasing interest in machine learning and its applications like data handling, data analysis & visualizations, prediction and classification capabilities, among many more, can we leverage these for noise removal, data conditioning tools, and signal characterization. Deep Learning, especially, has proved really effective at solving such problems where complex computations can be replaced by a well-trained model and used for predicting in the future.

This project is based on a recent kaggle competition and was an introduction to the world of _Big Data_ as a large dataset of 72GB size was managed for this project. While using deep learning models to solve this problem, had to overcome computational bottleneck challenges by building a `TensorFlow` data pipeline. Used concepts from signal processing to transform data and predict GW by training CNNs.
